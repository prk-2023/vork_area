# Struture of DNA:

Here’s a simple set of notes for Grade 9 students on the **Structure of DNA**:

### **Structure of DNA**

**DNA** stands for **Deoxyribonucleic Acid**, and it carries the genetic information necessary for the 
growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. 

For Eukaryotes DNA is located in the nucleus of cells.
For prokaryotes DNA is in the cytoplasm.

#### 1. **Basic Structure**

- DNA is a **long molecule** made up of **nucleotides**.
- A **nucleotide** consists of three parts:
  - **Sugar** (Deoxyribose, a 5-carbon sugar)
  - **Phosphate group** (PO₄)
  - **Nitrogenous base** (one of four: Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), or Guanine (G))

#### 2. **The Double Helix**

- DNA has a **double helix** structure, which looks like a twisted ladder.
- It consists of two long strands of nucleotides running in opposite directions (antiparallel), forming a 
  spiral shape.
- The **backbone** of the DNA is made of alternating sugar and phosphate groups.
- The **rungs of the ladder** are made of pairs of nitrogenous bases connected by **hydrogen bonds**.

#### 3. **Base Pairing Rule**

- **Adenine (A)** always pairs with **Thymine (T)** (A-T).
- **Cytosine (C)** always pairs with **Guanine (G)** (C-G).
- These pairs are held together by **hydrogen bonds**.
- This base-pairing ensures that the genetic code is preserved when DNA replicates.

#### 4. **Antiparallel Strands**

- The two strands of DNA are **antiparallel**, meaning one strand runs in a 5' to 3' direction, while the 
  other runs in the 3' to 5' direction.
  - The numbers 5' and 3' refer to the carbon atoms in the sugar molecule.
- This orientation is crucial for DNA replication and function.

#### 5. **Genes and Chromosomes**

- **Genes** are specific sequences of nitrogenous bases that code for proteins.
- A **chromosome** is a structure that holds a long strand of DNA coiled around proteins called **histones**.
- Humans have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs) in most of their cells.

#### 6. **DNA Replication**

- **DNA replication** is the process by which DNA makes a copy of itself.
  - This happens before cell division.
  - The two strands of DNA separate, and new complementary strands are created using the base-pairing rules.

#### 7. **Functions of DNA**

- **Storing genetic information**: DNA contains the instructions needed to make proteins, which are 
  essential for life.

- **Protein synthesis**: DNA directs the creation of proteins through a process known as 
  **transcription** and **translation**.
  
- **Inheritance**: DNA is passed from one generation to the next, ensuring that traits are inherited.

#### **Key Terms**
- **DNA** – Deoxyribonucleic acid, carries genetic information.
- **Nucleotide** – The building block of DNA.
- **Double helix** – The twisted ladder structure of DNA.
- **Base pairs** – Adenine-Thymine (A-T), Cytosine-Guanine (C-G).
- **Gene** – A segment of DNA that codes for a protein.
- **Chromosome** – A structure made of coiled DNA.
