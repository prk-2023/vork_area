- 'rustup': Rust toolchain installer.

- Rustup installs The Rust Programming Language from the official release channels, enabling you to easily
  switch between stable, beta, and nightly compilers and keep them updated. It makes cross-compiling simpler
  with binary builds of the standard library for common platforms.

- primary role is to manage multiple Rust toolchains on a single system, making it easier to work work with
  different versions of Rust and its dependencies.

- Features:
    - toolchain management: ( install, update, manage multiple Rust toolchains including stable, beta, alpha
      and nightly channels )
    - version management: switch between different version of Rust
    - Dependencies management: manages dependencies for each toolchain, ensuring that the correct version of
      dependencies are used for each project.
    - Override management: temporarily override the default toolchain for specific project or directory.
