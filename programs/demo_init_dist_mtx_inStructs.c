/* Note that the `offsetof` macro is used to calculate the offsets of the mutexes and conditions within the 
 * structure. This macro is defined in the `stddef.h` header file.
 *
 * Also, the `pthread_mutex_t` and `pthread_cond_t` types are used to represent the mutexes and conditions.
 * These types are defined in the `pthread.h` header file.
 *
 * The `pthread_mutex_init` and `pthread_cond_init` functions are used to initialize the mutexes and 
 * conditions, respectively. The `pthread_mutex_destroy` and `pthread_cond_destroy` functions are used to 
 * destroy them.
 *
 * This program assumes that the mutexes and conditions are used in a multithreaded environment, 
 * where multiple threads may access the same mutexes and conditions concurrently. 
 * In such an environment, it's essential to properly initialize and destroy the mutexes and conditions to 
 * avoid deadlocks and other synchronization issues.
