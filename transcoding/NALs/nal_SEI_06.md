# SEI Nal Unit:
---
The **SEI (Supplemental Enhancement Information)** NAL unit is a type of **NAL unit** used in video 
compression standards like **H.264 (AVC)** and **H.265 (HEVC)**. It carries additional information about 
the video that is not essential for decoding the video itself, but may provide enhancement or auxiliary 
information for specific applications or optimizations during decoding or playback.

The **SEI** NAL unit is used for transmitting supplementary data that can enhance or complement the core 
video stream. 

This data can include things like timing information, metadata related to the video content (ex:color space,
display resolution), or specific instructions for the decoder or display device.

### **Purpose of the SEI NAL Unit**

The **SEI NAL unit** is designed to carry non-essential information that can help improve the playback or 
presentation of the video. This can include:

- **Timing information**: Such as frame rate, picture timing, or synchronization with other media.
- **Colorimetry metadata**: For specifying the color format or primaries used in the video.
- **Dynamic Range or High Dynamic Range (HDR)**: Information regarding color depth, brightness, and other 
  display-related parameters.
- **Scene Information**: Metadata about the video content, such as scene changes or video content 
  classification.
- **Video parameter enhancements**: Information about the video's layout, resolution, or viewport for more 
  efficient display on different devices.

These pieces of information can be used by decoders, renderers, or media players to provide better playback, 
dynamic color adjustments, or syncing with other media sources.

### **How to Identify the SEI NALU in the Bitstream**
To identify an **SEI NAL unit** in the bitstream, you can follow these steps:

#### 1. **NAL Unit Start Code**
- As with all NAL units, the **SEI** NAL unit begins with a **start code** (`0x00 0x00 0x01`). 
  This marks the beginning of the NAL unit and is followed by the NAL header and the SEI payload.

#### 2. **NAL Unit Type**
- The NAL header contains a **NAL unit type** field that indicates the kind of NAL unit. 
  For the **SEI NAL unit**, the NAL unit type is:
  - **H.264**: `6` (decimal) or `0x06` (hexadecimal).
  - **H.265**: `39` (decimal) or `0x27` (hexadecimal).
  
  The **NAL unit type** field is typically the 5th byte in the NAL header.

#### 3. **NAL Header**
- The **NAL header** includes more than just the NAL unit type. It also contains information about the 
  NAL unit's reference status and whether it is a "forbidden zero" or a "non-reference" frame. 
  However, the **NAL unit type** is the key field for identifying the **SEI** unit.

#### 4. **SEI Payload**
- After the NAL header, the **SEI NAL unit** contains the **payload**, which carries the actual 
  **Supplemental Enhancement Information**. The payload can vary depending on the type of SEI message, 
  but it typically includes a sequence of data that decodes into a specific piece of information 
  (ex frame timing, color information, HDR parameters).
  
### **Types of SEI Messages**
The **SEI NAL unit** can carry various types of **SEI messages**. Some common types of SEI messages include:

1. **Frame Packing Arrangement**: Information related to 3D video (e.g., how the frames are packed for 
   stereoscopic 3D displays).
2. **Mastering Display Color Volume**: Information for color management and HDR (e.g., color primaries, max
   luminance).
3. **Tone Mapping**: Instructions for how to adjust the dynamic range of a video for HDR or different 
   display devices.
4. **Buffering Period**: Information related to video buffer size and timing, useful for video streaming or
   live broadcast.
5. **User Data**: General-purpose data that can be used for various applications, such as watermarking, 
   annotations, or custom data.
6. **Pic Timing**: Timing information related to picture display (e.g., frame rate, timestamps for 
    synchronization).

Each SEI message has a specific structure, and each message type is identified by a 
**message type identifier** within the SEI payload.

### **Example of SEI NAL Unit in the Bitstream**

Hereâ€™s a simplified example of what an **SEI NAL unit** might look like in the bitstream:

#### **H.264 Example**:
```
00 00 01 06 [SEI Header Byte(s)] [SEI Payload Data]
```
Where:
- `00 00 01` is the **start code**.
- `06` is the **NAL header** byte, indicating that this is an **SEI NAL unit** (NAL unit type `6`).
- The rest of the bytes represent the **SEI payload**, which contains the supplemental enhancement data 
  (e.g., timing info, HDR metadata, etc.).

#### **H.265 Example**:
```
00 00 01 27 [SEI Header Byte(s)] [SEI Payload Data]
```
Where:
- `00 00 01` is the **start code**.
- `27` is the **NAL header** byte, indicating that this is an **SEI NAL unit** (NAL unit type `39` in decimal).
- The rest of the bytes represent the **SEI payload**, containing specific **SEI messages**.

### **Structure of the SEI NAL Unit Payload**

The **SEI NAL unit** has a flexible structure, as the payload can contain different types of SEI messages. 
Each SEI message is typically composed of the following parts:

1. **Message Type (Identifier)**:
   - A field that identifies the type of SEI message being carried in the payload. 
     This helps the decoder know how to interpret the rest of the data.
   
2. **Message Data**:
   - The data that corresponds to the specific type of message. 
     For example, if the SEI message type is **Mastering Display Color Volume**, the data might include 
     values like color primaries, maximum luminance, and minimum luminance.
   
3. **Message Size**:
   - The size of the SEI message or the number of bytes needed to decode the SEI data.

4. **Payload Syntax**:
   - The syntax and structure of the payload vary depending on the message type. For example:
     - **Frame Packing Arrangement** SEI might include information on how stereoscopic 3D frames are packed.
     - **Mastering Display Color Volume** SEI might include parameters for high dynamic range (HDR) video 
       display settings.

### **Conclusion**
The **SEI (Supplemental Enhancement Information)** NAL unit is used to transmit additional metadata or 
auxiliary information that enhances the video stream, such as timing details, colorimetry, HDR metadata, or 
other non-essential information for better display or optimization during playback. 

To identify an **SEI NAL unit** in the bitstream:
1. Look for the **start code** (`0x00 0x00 0x01`).
2. Check the **NAL unit type** in the **NAL header** (`0x06` for **H.264** or `0x27` for **H.265`).
3. Parse the **SEI payload**, which contains the actual supplemental information. 
   The payload includes one or more **SEI messages** identified by a message type field.

The **SEI NAL unit** provides valuable additional information for applications such as video streaming, 
playback optimizations, HDR video, and more, although it is not necessary for the core decoding process.


# SEI Meta-data:
---
The **SEI (Supplemental Enhancement Information)** NAL unit carries non-essential, additional metadata in 
video compression standards like **H.264 (AVC)** and **H.265 (HEVC)**. 
This metadata is supplemental to the video bitstream and is not strictly required for decoding the video, 
but it enhances the playback, display, or processing of the video stream. 
It can include information about the video's presentation, color properties, timing, dynamic range, and 
other parameters.

The **SEI NAL unit** can carry different types of **SEI messages** (also referred to as "SEI payloads"), 
each designed to convey specific types of information that might be useful for decoders, display devices, 
or media players.

### **Purpose of SEI NAL Unit Metadata**

The purpose of the **SEI NAL unit** is to provide additional data that may help optimize or enhance the
