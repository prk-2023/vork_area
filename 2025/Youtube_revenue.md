1. **Audience Income Level** – Richer audiences = higher ad bids.
2. **B2B Focus** – Business-related niches often get enterprise ad money.

  **low CPMs** (\$0.50 – \$2) unless monetized through:

  * Sponsorships
  * Merch
  * Patreon/subs

---

### 🔑 **Key Takeaways**

* To **maximize YouTube revenue**, focus on:

  * High-CPM niches like **finance, education, tech**
  * Long-form, informative content
  * Clear metadata (titles, descriptions, thumbnails) to signal ad-friendly content

highly profitable, but the revenue per view varies significantly based on several factors:

---

### 💰 **Estimated YouTube CPM for Finance Content**

Finance-related content generally attracts higher CPMs due to its appeal to advertisers targeting affluent, 
investment-savvy audiences. 

For instance, creators like Marko Zlatic have reported CPMs ranging from **\$20 to \$27 per 1,000 views**.
([Business Insider][1])

---

### 🌍 **Geographical Impact on Revenue**

The CPM can fluctuate based on the viewer's location:

* **United States**: Approximately **\$32.75 per 1,000 views** .
* **Russia**: Around **\$4.76 per 1,000 views** .

Therefore, content viewed predominantly by U.S. audiences will yield higher revenue compared to Russian viewers.

### ⚠️ **Monetization Restrictions in Russia**

Due to geopolitical tensions, YouTube has paused all monetization features in Russia. 
This means that videos watched in Russia, regardless of the creator's location, will not generate ad revenue.

---

### 🧾 **Example Breakdown**

| --------- | --------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| USA       | 80%       | \$30         | \$24.00                             |
| UK        | 10%       | \$20         | \$2.00                              |
| India     | 10%       | \$2          | \$0.20                              |
| **Total** | 100%      | —            | **\$26.20 / 1,000 views**           |

➡️ So **you earn close to \$26 per 1,000 views**, even though you’re uploading from India.
