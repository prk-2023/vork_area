# Bells theorem:

EPR paper questioned the Quantum mechanical description of realism as incomplete. 
And pointed, that there should be some thing missing in the description of quantum mechanics formulation of
reality and pointed that there should be some kind of hidden variables, to explain non-local behaviour 
and realism which Einstein thought are fundamental. 

In Bells paper on Bells inequality, he wanted to see:

    * If there is any way to put into a quantum like framework, i.e a way of describing or ascribing to
      Quantum objects definite properties prior to an independent of our measurements of them.
      And if so could those properties also nonetherless obey what we might call kind of Locality or Local
      causality.
      I.E is there a way to make QM look more compatible with Relativity where nothing travels faster then
      speed of light. ( which is refered to as Locality )
    * And in which there are really are definite properties to little bits of matter that we can attribute 
      weather we perform measurements or not. 

    These are the guiding principles people like Einstein thought should be acceptable for a physical theory 
    and Bell thought that those were awfully reasonable principles.


Breaking the above Bells theorem for a clear understanding:

### Bell‚Äôs Theorem and the Questions It Raised

Bell was trying to address key questions about QM and its compatibility with classical ideas of 
**realism** (that objects have definite properties whether or not we measure them),
and 
**locality** (the idea that information or effects cannot travel faster than light, and distant objects 
cannot instantaneously influence one another).

In short, he wanted to see if quantum mechanics could be made to look like a theory in which particles have 
well-defined properties independent of measurement and respect the principle of locality, or 
if it necessarily violates these classical ideas.

### Bell's Inequality and Its Significance

Bell‚Äôs theorem (1964) showed that any physical theory that satisfies **local realism** 
(which combines **locality** and **realism**) would have to obey a certain kind of mathematical inequality, 
now known as **Bell‚Äôs Inequality**.

Local realism means that:

* **Locality**: 
    The outcome of measurements on a particle should not be influenced by actions performed far away 
    (no faster-than-light influence). ( steering )
* **Realism**: 
    The properties of a particle, such as its spin or polarization, exist before and independent of measurement.

QM, on the other hand, predicts correlations between measurements that cannot be explained by local realism. 
Bell showed that if local realism holds, certain inequalities (Bell‚Äôs Inequality) would be true.

### What Bell‚Äôs Inequality Means

Bell formulated an inequality that essentially places a limit on how much correlation can exist between 
measurements of certain properties (like the polarization or spin of particles) if those properties are 
pre-existing (realism) and the events are local. 
The key point is that quantum mechanics predicts correlations that **violate** Bell‚Äôs Inequality.

Bell‚Äôs inequality is essentially a mathematical test. 
It predicts that if we make certain types of measurements on quantum particles (such as pairs of entangled 
photons), the correlations between the results of those measurements will **exceed** the limits set by local
realism. 
Quantum mechanics, in this case, says that the particles don‚Äôt have pre-defined, independent properties 
before measurement, and the outcomes of measurements on one particle can instantaneously affect outcomes 
on the other (even if they are far apart). 
This suggests a **non-local** influence between entangled particles, which seems to violate the 
principle of locality.

### Experimental Violations

In the decades after Bell's work, experimental tests were conducted using entangled particles, most notably 
by physicists like Alain Aspect in the 1980s. 
These experiments have consistently shown that the correlations predicted by quantum mechanics 
**violate** Bell‚Äôs Inequality, supporting the conclusion that quantum mechanics cannot be reconciled with 
the assumptions of local realism.

### Conclusion

So, **Bell‚Äôs Inequality** shows that any theory that respects both locality and realism 
(the idea that particles have definite properties independent of measurement) cannot explain the behavior 
of quantum systems. 
The violation of Bell‚Äôs inequality in experiments suggests that quantum mechanics describes a world where:

* Particles don't have definite properties until measured (reality is "created" by measurement),
* And there can be **non-local** effects (entanglement) that seem to involve instantaneous influences, 
  which go against the notion that nothing can travel faster than light.

This is one of the core findings that pushes quantum mechanics away from classical ideas and shows its 
fundamentally different nature. 

It implies that the universe, at a quantum level, doesn‚Äôt behave in a way that is compatible with our 
classical ideas of reality and causality.

Would you like to go into more detail about any part of this?


---------------------------------------------------


Since Bell's Theorem connects a few deep ideas
- **quantum entanglement**, 
- **realism**, 
- **locality**, and 
- **hidden variables**

let‚Äôs build a more intuitive understanding of each, and then walk step by step through
**what Bell actually did**.

---

## üîπ 1. The Background: What Was the Problem?

Einstein and others (like Podolsky and Rosen in their famous 1935 EPR paper) were uncomfortable with the 
idea that **quantum mechanics only tells us probabilities**, and that particles 
**don't have definite properties** until we measure them. 

That seems weird‚Äîshouldn‚Äôt an electron, for example, *have* a spin value whether or not we look?

So they proposed that **quantum mechanics might be incomplete**, and that there could be 
‚Äúhidden variables‚Äù that carry the real, definite properties of particles. 
These hidden variables would determine the outcomes of quantum experiments, but are just hidden from us.

The catch is: Einstein also insisted that these variables should respect **locality**‚Äîmeaning, nothing, 
not even information, can travel faster than light.

---

## üîπ 2. Bell‚Äôs Core Insight

Bell asked: 
*‚ÄúCan you have a theory with hidden variables that explains quantum predictions, and still respects locality?‚Äù*

He showed: **No.**

Bell created a mathematical inequality that *must* be obeyed if such a theory exists. 
But quantum mechanics predicts violations of that inequality. 
And experiments confirm: **quantum mechanics wins**, and the inequality is **violated**.

---

## üîπ 3. An Intuitive Example

Let‚Äôs say we have a pair of entangled particles. 
When measured, each gives a result of either +1 or ‚Äì1. 
You and a friend are far apart (say, you're on Earth and your friend is on Mars), each with a measuring 
device, and you measure each particle along different settings or directions.

Here‚Äôs the key:

* If **local realism** is true, the results of each particle's measurement are determined by:

  1. Pre-existing hidden variables
  2. The choice of measurement setting at *that location only*
  3. No influence from what the other person does (no faster-than-light influence)

From this, Bell derived an inequality. A simplified version is the **CHSH inequality** 
(named after Clauser, Horne, Shimony, and Holt):

$$
|E(a, b) + E(a, b') + E(a', b) - E(a', b')| \leq 2
$$

Here:

* $E(a, b)$ is the correlation between outcomes when you measure setting $a$ and your friend measures setting $b$
* The values of $a, a', b, b'$ are different directions or settings

Quantum mechanics, however, predicts that this inequality can go up to:

$$
|E(a, b) + E(a, b') + E(a', b) - E(a', b')| = 2\sqrt{2} \approx 2.828
$$

So if you do an experiment and get a value greater than 2, you‚Äôve violated Bell‚Äôs inequality.
And that‚Äôs exactly what we see in reality.

---

## üîπ 4. What This Means

So, if experiments **violate Bell‚Äôs inequality**, then **at least one** of these must be false:

* Realism: The idea that particles have definite properties before you measure them
* Locality: No faster-than-light influences
* Freedom of choice (you‚Äôre free to choose the measurement setting without it being pre-correlated with the 
  particle properties)

Most physicists today believe locality must be given up in some form‚Äîat least in how it‚Äôs traditionally 
defined. 

Quantum entanglement appears to involve **non-local correlations**: measuring one particle instantly affects 
the other, regardless of distance.

---

## üîπ 5. The Bottom Line

Bell's Inequality is a testable consequence of assuming a classical worldview (local realism). 
Quantum mechanics violates this inequality, and so does **nature** in actual experiments.

So Bell's Theorem is arguably the **strongest argument we have** that:

* The world is not locally causal in the classical sense
* **Quantum entanglement is real**
* Any deeper "theory" behind quantum mechanics cannot be both local and realist

---

Would you like the actual math behind a Bell-type experiment (like the CHSH test)?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs walk through the **actual math behind a Bell-type experiment**, specifically the 
**CHSH inequality**, which is the most widely used form of **Bell‚Äôs Inequality** in experiments.

---

## üîπ Overview of CHSH Setup

You have two observers:

* **Alice** on one side
* **Bob** on the other

Each can choose between **two possible measurement settings**:

* Alice chooses between settings $a$ and $a'$
* Bob chooses between settings $b$ and $b'$

Each measurement returns either **+1** or **‚Äì1**.

We assume that the outcomes depend on:

* The setting chosen
* A shared **hidden variable** $\lambda$ (if realism is true)

We'll define the **expected correlation** between outcomes as:

$$
E(a, b) = \int d\lambda\, \rho(\lambda)\, A(a, \lambda) B(b, \lambda)
$$

Where:

* $A(a, \lambda) \in \{+1, -1\}$ is Alice‚Äôs result depending on her setting and hidden variable
* $B(b, \lambda) \in \{+1, -1\}$ is Bob‚Äôs result
* $\rho(\lambda)$ is the probability distribution over hidden variables

---

## üîπ Step 1: Derive the CHSH Inequality

We now define the **CHSH combination** of expectation values:

$$
S = E(a, b) + E(a, b') + E(a', b) - E(a', b')
$$

Let‚Äôs analyze the expression under **local realism**. Assume the values of $A$ and $B$ are 
determined by $\lambda$, and that they take definite values $\pm1$.

Let‚Äôs define:

$$
C(\lambda) = A(a, \lambda) B(b, \lambda) + A(a, \lambda) B(b', \lambda) + A(a', \lambda) B(b, \lambda) - A(a', \lambda) B(b', \lambda)
$$

We‚Äôll now analyze the possible values that $C(\lambda)$ can take.

Factor out $A$:

$$
C(\lambda) = A(a, \lambda)[B(b, \lambda) + B(b', \lambda)] + A(a', \lambda)[B(b, \lambda) - B(b', \lambda)]
$$

Now notice:

* $A(a, \lambda), A(a', \lambda), B(b, \lambda), B(b', \lambda) \in \{+1, -1\}$
* So the term inside brackets can be ¬±2, 0, or ‚Äì2

Try all possibilities ‚Äî the **maximum value** of $|C(\lambda)|$ is **2**.

Then, integrating over all $\lambda$:

$$
|S| = \left| \int d\lambda\, \rho(\lambda) C(\lambda) \right| \leq \int d\lambda\, \rho(\lambda)\, |C(\lambda)| \leq \int d\lambda\, \rho(\lambda) \cdot 2 = 2
$$

So:

$$
|S| \leq 2
$$

This is **Bell‚Äôs (CHSH) Inequality**.

---

## üîπ Step 2: Quantum Mechanical Prediction

Now let‚Äôs compute what **quantum mechanics** predicts.

Suppose Alice and Bob share a **maximally entangled state** like the Bell state:

$$
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle_A |\downarrow\rangle_B - |\downarrow\rangle_A |\uparrow\rangle_B)
$$

Each person measures **spin** along a direction in the plane. Define directions (unit vectors in 2D):

* Alice measures at angle $a$ or $a'$
* Bob measures at angle $b$ or $b'$

Quantum mechanics predicts the correlation between results as:

$$
E(a, b) = -\cos(\theta_{ab})
$$

Where $\theta_{ab}$ is the angle between measurement directions $a$ and $b$.

Now let‚Äôs choose specific angles that maximize the CHSH expression:

* $a = 0^\circ$
* $a' = 90^\circ$
* $b = 45^\circ$
* $b' = -45^\circ$

Then we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
E(a, b) &= -\cos(45^\circ) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
E(a, b') &= -\cos(45^\circ) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
E(a', b) &= -\cos(45^\circ) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
E(a', b') &= -\cos(135^\circ) = +\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Now plug into the CHSH expression:

$$
S = E(a, b) + E(a, b') + E(a', b) - E(a', b') = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = -2\sqrt{2}
$$

So:

$$
|S| = 2\sqrt{2} \approx 2.828
$$

Which **violates** the classical limit of 2.

---

## üîπ Final Summary

| Theory               | Max CHSH Value |
| -------------------- | -------------- |
| Local realism (Bell) | 2              |
| Quantum mechanics    | $2\sqrt{2}$    |
| Experiment           | Matches QM     |

So:

* If you assume **local realism**, you must satisfy the CHSH inequality: $|S| \leq 2$
* But **quantum mechanics** violates this bound, and experiments confirm it
* This means that nature **cannot be explained by any local hidden variable theory**

---

How **quantum mechanics makes its predictions**, especially about 
**entangled particles** and **measurement correlations**. 

Let‚Äôs unpack where in quantum mechanics the correlation predictions come from and where to go to learn more.

---

## üîπ Where Does Quantum Mechanics Predict These Correlations?

The correlations that violate **Bell's Inequality** come from the **structure of entangled quantum states** 
and the **mathematics of quantum measurement**.

The prediction arises from **three key elements** of quantum theory:

### 1. **Quantum State** ‚Äî The Entangled State

For example, the **singlet state** (a type of entangled state) of two spin-1/2 particles (like electrons) is:

$$
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(|\uparrow\rangle_A |\downarrow\rangle_B - |\downarrow\rangle_A |\uparrow\rangle_B\right)
$$

This state describes **maximum entanglement**. 
It‚Äôs the reason the outcomes are perfectly correlated (or anti-correlated) in specific directions.

---

### 2. **Quantum Measurement Formalism**

In quantum mechanics, measurements are described using **projection operators** 
(or more generally, **observables** represented by Hermitian operators).

To compute the expected value of the measurement, we use:

$$
\langle \psi | \hat{A} \otimes \hat{B} | \psi \rangle
$$

This gives the **expected correlation** between measurements made by Alice and Bob on each particle, where:

* $\hat{A}$, $\hat{B}$ are spin measurement operators (say, along directions $\vec{a}, \vec{b}$)
* For spin-1/2 particles, these operators are related to **Pauli matrices** (like $\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z$)

---

### 3. **The Prediction Formula**

For spin measurements along directions $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$, quantum mechanics predicts the correlation:

$$
E(\vec{a}, \vec{b}) = -\cos(\theta)
$$

Where $\theta$ is the angle between the measurement directions $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$. 
This prediction violates Bell's inequality for certain choices of angles.

Would you like me to explain how the math in the code works step by step?
---

Great! Let me explain how the code works and how it calculates the **quantum correlations** in a **Bell-type experiment**.

### üß™ **Step-by-Step Explanation of the Code**

#### 1. **Pauli Matrices & Qubit States**

In quantum mechanics, measurements on quantum systems (like spin or polarization) are often represented 
by **operators**. For spin-1/2 particles, these operators are the **Pauli matrices**:

* $\sigma_x$ (X): Flips the spin state (Pauli-X matrix)
* $\sigma_z$ (Z): Measures the spin along the z-axis (Pauli-Z matrix)

We define these matrices in the code:

```python
X = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]])
Y = np.array([[0, -1j], [1j, 0]])
Z = np.array([[1, 0], [0, -1]])
```

These matrices are used to describe measurements along different axes.

#### 2. **Basis Vectors for Spin States**

Next, we define the **basis vectors** for the spin states of the particles. 
In quantum mechanics, for a spin-1/2 particle, the **up** state $|\uparrow\rangle$ is represented as:

$$
|\uparrow\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
$$

And the **down** state $|\downarrow\rangle$ is represented as:

$$
|\downarrow\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
$$

These are the basis vectors for the spin-up and spin-down states.

```python
up = np.array([[1], [0]])
down = np.array([[0], [1]])
```

#### 3. **The Singlet State (Entangled State)**

The **singlet state** is an entangled quantum state that describes two particles (e.g., two electrons) 
with opposite spins. The singlet state is given by:

$$
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle_A |\downarrow\rangle_B - |\downarrow\rangle_A |\uparrow\rangle_B)
$$

This state is maximally entangled, meaning the spins of the two particles are perfectly correlated.

```python
singlet_state = (np.kron(up, down) - np.kron(down, up)) / np.sqrt(2)
```

Here, we use the **Kronecker product** (`np.kron`) to combine the states of the two particles.

#### 4. **Constructing the Density Matrix**

The **density matrix** $\rho$ represents the state of the system, including entanglement. 
For a pure state like the singlet state, we calculate the density matrix as:

$$
\rho = |\psi\rangle \langle \psi|
$$

```python
rho = singlet_state @ singlet_state.T.conj()  # Density matrix
```

Here, we compute the outer product of $|\psi\rangle$ with its conjugate transpose (this gives us $\rho$).

#### 5. **Spin Measurement Operators**

Quantum measurements along an arbitrary direction $\theta$ are represented by the spin operator, 
which is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices. The general spin operator along an angle $\theta$ is:

$$
\hat{S}(\theta) = \cos(\theta) \sigma_z + \sin(\theta) \sigma_x
$$

This operator is used to measure spin along any axis in the plane.

```python
def spin_operator(theta_deg):
    theta = np.deg2rad(theta_deg)  # Convert angle to radians
    return np.cos(theta) * Z + np.sin(theta) * X
```

This function calculates the spin operator for any given angle $\theta$ (in degrees).

#### 6. **Correlation Function**

The **correlation function** $E(a, b)$ computes the expected outcome of measurements on two entangled 
particles when Alice and Bob measure along directions $a$ and $b$, respectively. This is given by:

$$
E(a, b) = \langle \psi | \hat{S}_A(a) \otimes \hat{S}_B(b) | \psi \rangle
$$

This is the **expectation value** of the product of the measurement operators for Alice and Bob.

```python
def correlation(theta_a, theta_b):
    A = spin_operator(theta_a)  # Alice's spin operator
    B = spin_operator(theta_b)  # Bob's spin operator
    operator = np.kron(A, B)  # Combine both operators
    return np.trace(rho @ operator).real  # Compute the expectation value (trace)
```

* We construct the **tensor product** $\hat{S}_A(a) \otimes \hat{S}_B(b)$ to account for the joint measurement of the two particles.
* The expectation value is the **trace** of the matrix product of $\rho$ and the joint measurement operator.

#### 7. **Angles for the CHSH Test**

The angles are chosen as part of the **CHSH Bell test** setup. 
Alice and Bob can measure their particles along different directions, such as 
$0^\circ$, $90^\circ$, $45^\circ$, and $-45^\circ$. 

The angles are encoded as:

```python
angles = {
    'a': 0,        # Alice's first measurement angle
    'a_prime': 90, # Alice's second measurement angle
    'b': 45,       # Bob's first measurement angle
    'b_prime': -45 # Bob's second measurement angle
}
```

#### 8. **Computing the CHSH Value**

Finally, we compute the **CHSH value** by summing the individual correlations:

$$
S = E(a, b) + E(a, b') + E(a', b) - E(a', b')
$$

```python
E_ab = correlation(angles['a'], angles['b'])
E_abp = correlation(angles['a'], angles['b_prime'])
E_apb = correlation(angles['a_prime'], angles['b'])
E_apbp = correlation(angles['a_prime'], angles['b_prime'])

S = E_ab + E_abp + E_apb - E_apbp
```

This gives us the CHSH value, which should be **greater than 2** for 
quantum mechanics (specifically, $2\sqrt{2} \approx 2.828$).

#### 9. **Output the Results**

Finally, we print the individual correlations and the CHSH value:

```python
print(f"E(a, b)       = {E_ab:.3f}")
print(f"E(a, b')      = {E_abp:.3f}")
print(f"E(a', b)      = {E_apb:.3f}")
print(f"E(a', b')     = {E_apbp:.3f}")
print(f"CHSH S-value  = {S:.3f}")
```

The expected output should show the correlation values for each pair of measurement settings and the CHSH 
value $S$.

---

### üîç **Conclusion**

* The **singlet state** creates entanglement between Alice and Bob‚Äôs particles.
* **Quantum mechanics** predicts **correlations** between their measurements, which depend on the angles 
  at which they measure.
* The **CHSH inequality** is used to test whether these correlations fit within the limits of 
  **local realism** (classical physics).
* Quantum mechanics predicts a **violation of the CHSH inequality**, which is what experiments have 
  confirmed, showing that the world behaves in a non-local way at the quantum level.

2. Derive the **singlet state** of two spin half particles.
---
## Derive the **singlet state** of two spin half particles.


To derive the **singlet state** of two spin-1/2 particles ‚Äî one of the four **Bell states** ‚Äî 
we need to understand how quantum spin, tensor products, and the **principles of antisymmetry** for 
fermions (like electrons) come into play.
---

### **1. Spin-1/2 System and Basis States**

Each spin-1/2 particle has two possible spin states along the z-axis:

* $|\uparrow\rangle$: spin up
* $|\downarrow\rangle$: spin down

For a two-particle system, the state space is the **tensor product** of the two individual Hilbert spaces. 
The **basis states** for this combined system are:

* $|\uparrow\rangle_A |\uparrow\rangle_B$
* $|\uparrow\rangle_A |\downarrow\rangle_B$
* $|\downarrow\rangle_A |\uparrow\rangle_B$
* $|\downarrow\rangle_A |\downarrow\rangle_B$

These form a **complete basis** for the two-spin system.

---

### **2. Total Spin: Singlet vs Triplet**

In quantum mechanics, when combining two spin-1/2 particles, the total spin $\vec{S} = \vec{S}_A + \vec{S}_B$ can be either:

* **Triplet states**: Total spin $S = 1$, symmetric under particle exchange
* **Singlet state**: Total spin $S = 0$, antisymmetric under particle exchange

The **singlet state** corresponds to total spin 0, which is unique (1-dimensional subspace) and 
**antisymmetric** under exchange of particles. By contrast, triplet states span a 3-dimensional symmetric subspace.

---

### **3. Constructing the Singlet State**

We want a **normalized**, **antisymmetric** superposition of the two basis states that contain one 
up-spin and one down-spin:

* $|\uparrow\rangle_A |\downarrow\rangle_B$
* $|\downarrow\rangle_A |\uparrow\rangle_B$

Swapping A and B:

* $|\uparrow\rangle_A |\downarrow\rangle_B \rightarrow |\uparrow\rangle_B |\downarrow\rangle_A = |\downarrow\rangle_A |\uparrow\rangle_B$

So the **antisymmetric combination** is:

$$
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle_A |\downarrow\rangle_B - |\downarrow\rangle_A |\uparrow\rangle_B \right)
$$

This state has the following properties:

* **Antisymmetric under particle exchange**:

  $$
  P_{AB} |\psi\rangle = -|\psi\rangle
  $$
* **Total spin** $S = 0$
* **Normalized**:

  $$
  \langle \psi | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \left( \langle \uparrow \downarrow | \uparrow \downarrow \rangle + \langle \downarrow \uparrow | \downarrow \uparrow \rangle \right) = 1
  $$

### ‚úÖ Final Result:

$$
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle_A |\downarrow\rangle_B - |\downarrow\rangle_A |\uparrow\rangle_B \right)
$$

This is the **singlet state**, an example of **maximal entanglement**. Measurement of one spin immediately 
determines the other ‚Äî if A is found up, B is guaranteed down, and vice versa.

Let me know if you'd like to see the derivation in matrix form or via angular momentum operators.

let‚Äôs now **derive the singlet state using matrix representations** and **angular momentum operators** to 
further deepen the understanding.

## **A. Spin-1/2 in Matrix Form**

A spin-1/2 particle‚Äôs states are represented as two-component vectors:

$$
|\uparrow\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad |\downarrow\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
$$

So the two-particle basis states in the **tensor product space** (4D vector space) become:

* $|\uparrow\rangle_A |\uparrow\rangle_B = |\uparrow\uparrow\rangle = \begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\0\\0\end{pmatrix}$
* $|\uparrow\rangle_A |\downarrow\rangle_B = |\uparrow\downarrow\rangle = \begin{pmatrix}0\\1\\0\\0\end{pmatrix}$
* $|\downarrow\rangle_A |\uparrow\rangle_B = |\downarrow\uparrow\rangle = \begin{pmatrix}0\\0\\1\\0\end{pmatrix}$
* $|\downarrow\rangle_A |\downarrow\rangle_B = |\downarrow\downarrow\rangle = \begin{pmatrix}0\\0\\0\\1\end{pmatrix}$

## **B. Angular Momentum Operators**

For spin, we use **Pauli matrices**:

$$
S_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x, \quad S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y, \quad S_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_z
$$

Where:

$$
\sigma_x = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad
\sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad
\sigma_z = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
$$

To construct the **total spin operator**, we define:

$$
\vec{S}_{\text{tot}} = \vec{S}_A + \vec{S}_B
$$

And the **total spin squared**:

$$
\vec{S}_{\text{tot}}^2 = (\vec{S}_A + \vec{S}_B)^2 = \vec{S}_A^2 + \vec{S}_B^2 + 2 \vec{S}_A \cdot \vec{S}_B
$$

Each spin has:

$$
\vec{S}_A^2 = \vec{S}_B^2 = \frac{3}{4} \hbar^2
$$

So the eigenvalue of $\vec{S}_{\text{tot}}^2$ is:

* $S(S+1)\hbar^2$, where $S = 0$ (singlet) or $S = 1$ (triplet)

---

## **C. Finding the Singlet Eigenstate**

We want a state $|\psi\rangle$ such that:

$$
\vec{S}_{\text{tot}}^2 |\psi\rangle = 0 \quad \text{(for the singlet)}
$$

This uniquely picks out the antisymmetric combination:

$$
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\downarrow\rangle - |\downarrow\uparrow\rangle \right)
$$

This is because:

* The symmetric combinations form the triplet $S=1$ subspace.
* The antisymmetric one is orthogonal to all of them and lies in the $S=0$ subspace.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

We‚Äôve now derived the singlet state using two methods:

1. **Symmetry and antisymmetry principles** (qualitative)
2. **Spin matrix and total angular momentum operators** (quantitative)

The result is always:

$$
|\psi\rangle_{\text{singlet}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle_A |\downarrow\rangle_B - |\downarrow\rangle_A |\uparrow\rangle_B \right)
$$

This is one of the most fundamental entangled states in quantum mechanics, central to EPR paradoxes, 
Bell tests, and quantum information theory.

Would you like to explore how this leads to **violations of Bell inequalities**, or how measurement on one 
particle affects the other?
