# Tensors:


## 1. Motivation: direction dependence in physics 

In many physical systems the response in one direction is not the same as in another direction:
i.e these systems are classified as **anisotropic**. 
(ref: https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_31.html )

Example: **polarizability** in crystals: When you apply an electric field $E$ you get a polarization $P$ (
dipole moment per volume). In an isotropic, the relation is simple:

$$
    \mathbf{P} = \alpha * \mathbf{E}
$$
with a single scalar $\alpha$.
But in a crystal, $\alpha$ depends on the direction: 
A field in one direction might produce polarization in another direction, etc ...

Thus the simplest "linear response" law must generalize from $\mathbf{P} = \alpha * \mathbf{E}$ ( scalar
proportionality ) to something that can accomodate cross-components: 

$$
P_x = \alpha_{xx} E_x + \alpha_{xy} E_y + \alpha_{xz} E_z,
$$
$$
P_y = \alpha_{yx} E_x + \alpha_{yy} E_y + \alpha_{yz} E_z,
$$
$$
P_z = \alpha_{zx} E_x + \alpha_{zy} E_y + \alpha_{zz} E_z.
$$

In compact notation:

$$
P_i = \sum_j \alpha_{ij},E_j.  \tag{31.5}
$$


Here the “nine numbers” $\alpha_{ij} for (i,j = x,y,z)$ capture *all* of the linear relation between 
$\mathbf{E}$ and  $\mathbf {P}$.

This set of nine numbers ( given a coordinate system) is called the **tensor of polarizability**.

So from the state, what emerges is :

> A **Tensor** ( here its called "2nd rank" ) is a collection of components ${T_{ij}}$ that linearly relate
> vector components to vector components, or more generally transforms in a particular way under change of
> co-ordinate axes. 

Note: In Feynman lectures focuses more on presenting **tensors** from the physics of anisotropy. 


## 2. Transformation properties under change of axes: 

A key property that distinguishes a mere array of numbers from a **tensor** is how the components change
when (transformations) you rotate or change your co-ordinate system. 

But Physical relations between $E$ and $P$ should now be dependent on co-ordinate axes you choose. (
Universal laws )

So if you go from $(x,y,z)$ to a new $(x',y',z')$ the same physical field vectors $\mathbf{E}$, $\mathbf{P}$
have different components in the primed system.
=> The new components $E_{x'}, E_{y'}, E_{z'}$ are linear combinations of the old ones; 
=> likewise for $P_{x'},\dots$. 
You then deduce how the components $\alpha_{i'j'}$ in the new system must relate to the old $\alpha_{ij}$.

Thus a **tensor** is an object who's components transform in a definite rule under a change of basis (
co-ordinate transformation ), such that the physical relations ( like $P_i = \sum_j \alpha_{ij} E_j)$ ) 
remains valid in any basis.

Using the vector transformation, the tensor components like $\alpha_{ij}$  changes under co-ordinate
transformation to keep physical law unchanged. 
Ex: 
Suppose in one coordinate system you have:
$$ 
    P_x = \alpha_{xx} E_x + \alpha_{xy} E_y
$$

Now, rotate your axes by 90°. The same physical vectors $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{E}$ now have new 
components $P_{x'}$, $E_{x'}$, etc.

To keep the equation valid in the new system:

$$
    P_{x'} = \alpha_{x'x'} E_{x'} + \alpha_{x'y'} E_{y'}
$$

The **new components** $\alpha_{x'x'}$ , etc., must be **combinations of the old ones** — this rule defines 
how tensors transform.

> This shows: to keep physical laws the same in any coordinate system, the tensor components must transform 
> in a specific way — that’s what makes them tensors.

## 3. From vectors and scalars to tensor ranks

* A **scalar** (rank 0 tensor) is just a number; it’s invariant (no indices).
* A **vector** (rank 1 tensor) has components $V_i$, transforms like a vector.
* A **rank 2 tensor** has components $T_{ij}$. In the polarization example, $\alpha_{ij}$ is rank 2.

By contracting (summing) indices:

* If you sum one index of a rank‑2 tensor with a vector, you get a vector: $(T_{ij} E_j =$ vector with i-index.

* If you sum both indices with two vectors, you get a scalar: $E_i T_{ij} E_j$. 
  Indeed, in the polarization energy expression,

  $$
    u_P = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j} \alpha_{ij} E_i E_j 
  $$

is a scalar (energy density), independent of the coordinate choice. 

So one hallmark of a tensor is its behavior under these index summations with vectors.

It is to note that many physical tensors are symmetric (i.e. $T_{ij} = T_{ji}$ ), such as in the 
polarizability tensor in many crystals or the inertia tensor ( In gravitation theory ). 


## 4. Geometric intuition: ellipsoids and principal axes

To help intuition, Feynman introduces the idea of the “energy ellipsoid.” The idea:

* Consider the relation $u_P = \tfrac12 \sum_{i,j} \alpha_{ij} E_i E_j$.

* Fix $u_P = u_0$. Then the set of $\mathbf{E}$ that satisfy that is an ellipsoid in the $(E_x, E_y, E_z)$
  space

* The shape of that ellipsoid encodes the anisotropy of the medium: directions in which the field costs more
 
   or less “energy” to polarize.

* By diagonalizing the tensor (i.e. finding eigenvectors / principal axes), one picks a coordinate system 
  in which $\alpha_{ij}$ is diagonal (only three nonzero diagonal entries) so that in those special axes, 
  $P$ is parallel to $E$.

Thus any symmetric tensor of rank 2 can be “diagonalized” in an appropriate coordinate system. 
That gives you great insight: the general tensor can be thought of as a “stretched sphere” (ellipsoid) in 
some transformed space.

This geometric view is powerful: it shows that a tensor is not just “a big table of numbers,” but has 
intrinsic geometric meaning (eigen‐directions, magnitude in those directions) independent of coordinate choice.

---

## 5. More physics examples: inertia, stress, etc.

Familiar physical quantities that are tensors:

* **Moment of inertia tensor**: $\displaystyle L_i = \sum_j I_{ij},\omega_j$. 
  The kinetic energy is $\tfrac12 \sum_{ij} I_{ij},\omega_i,\omega_j$. 

* **Stress tensor** $S_{ij}$: relating the force (vector) across a surface whose normal is $\mathbf{n}$. 
  The force per unit area has components $S_{ij},n_j$.

* **Elastic tensors**: The relation between stress and strain is linear in many materials, but the 
  "stiffness tensor" is of rank 4: $\gamma_{ijkl}$ because $T_{ij} = \sum_{k,l} \gamma_{ijkl} S_{kl}$.

* In relativity, the stress–energy tensor $S_{\mu\nu}) is a rank‑2 tensor in spacetime $4×4$, 
  capturing energy density, momentum flow, pressure, etc. 

These examples show that the concept of tensor is extremely general and pervasive in physics.

---

## 6. Summing up: what is a tensor?

Putting together the insights from Feynman’s approach, here is a conceptual summary and “definition by 
inference”:

* A **tensor of rank $n$** is an object with $(n)$ indices (e.g. $T_{i!j!k\cdots}$ ) whose components 
  transform in a definite linear way under changes of coordinate axes (or basis), such that 
  geometric / physical relations (e.g. linear relations between vectors, energy expressions) remain valid 
  and coordinate‐independent.

* A rank‑2 tensor $T_{ij}$ often represents a linear mapping from one vector to another: 
  $(T\mathbf{v})_{i} = \sum_j T_{ij} v_j$. 

  In physics, many such mappings occur (like relating field to response, stress to deformation, etc.)

* One can contract tensors with vectors (or other tensors) to get lower‐rank objects (vectors or scalars). 
  The contraction respects the tensorial nature (i.e. coordinate invariance).

* A symmetric tensor (e.g. $T_{ij} = T_{ji}$ ) can be diagonalized; 
  its eigenvalues and eigenvectors have intrinsic meaning.

* The physical examples (polarizability, stress, inertia, elasticity, electromagnetic energy–momentum) show
  how tensors arise naturally.

* The geometric picture of ellipsoids (or more generally quadric forms) helps you *see* what the tensor 
  "does" to vector directions — which directions are "stiffer", which directions cause larger response, etc.

* Crucially, Feynman’s route is: **start from physics**, let the need to encode directional dependence 
  push you to a generalized linear relation, observe how it must transform under a coordinate change, and 
  then see its geometric and algebraic properties emerge. 

> By the end, you are left with a clear idea of what a tensor is — as a transformation‐law object, not
> merely a big matrix.

## 7. A simple toy rephrasing / mini‑example

To make it even more transparent, here’s a little toy you can try in your mind or on paper.

Suppose you have a 2D system (so indices run over (x,y)). Suppose you find experimentally:

* If you apply a force $F$ along the $x$-direction, you get a displacement with components $u_x = a F_x$,
  $u_y = b F_x$.

* If you apply $F$ along $y$-direction, you get $u_x = c F_y$, $u_y = d F_y$.

Then you postulate

$$
u_i = \sum_j T_{ij} , F_j
$$

with matrix

$$
T = \begin{pmatrix} a & c \\ b & d \end{pmatrix}.
$$

You then ask: what happens if I rotate my coordinate axes by some angle $\theta$? 

The numerical entries $(a, b, c, d)$ will change to some new entries $T_{i'j'}$, in a specific way 
(you can derive the transformation rule). As long as you do that, the physical law $u_i = T_{ij} F_j$ stays 
valid in any coordinate system. That is the sign that $T$ is a tensor.

You can also plot the "quadratic form" $F_i T_{ij} F_j = \text{(energy)}$, see an ellipse, find principal
directions, diagonalize (T) by rotating axes, etc.

# Tensors 

**History** :

Understanding the **history before tensors** helps explain *why* tensors were developed and
*what problems they solved*. 

Tensors didn’t appear out of nowhere; they came from a need to describe more complex mathematical and 
physical ideas in a clear, coordinate-independent way.

Here’s a brief timeline and background of the key ideas that led to tensors:

---

## 📜 **Historical Background Before Tensors**

### 1. **Vectors and Coordinate Geometry (1600s–1700s)**

* **René Descartes** developed **coordinate geometry**, linking algebra and geometry.
* Later, **Isaac Newton** and **Gottfried Leibniz** developed **calculus**, which was used to describe 
  motion, force, and change.
* However, these tools were mostly limited to scalars and vectors, which weren’t enough for describing
  things like how forces act in different directions at once (e.g., stress inside materials).

---

### 2. **Linear Algebra and Matrices (1700s–1800s)**

* **Matrices** and **systems of linear equations** became important tools for organizing numbers that
  changes with direction.
* **Augustin-Louis Cauchy** (early 1800s) used early forms of tensors to describe **stress** in materials 
  — this was the **first real physical use of tensor-like objects**, though the word "tensor" wasn’t used 
  yet.

---

### 3. **Differential Geometry and Curved Space (1800s)**

* **Carl Friedrich Gauss** and **Bernhard Riemann** developed **differential geometry** :
  studying curved surfaces and spaces.
* Riemann introduced the idea of a **metric tensor**, which describes distances & angles on curved surfaces.
* This was a huge step, because it allowed people to describe space and geometry 
  **without needing flat coordinates**.

---

### 4. **Formal Tensor Calculus (Late 1800s)**

* **Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro** and his student **Tullio Levi-Civita** developed **tensor calculus** 
  (also called **absolute differential calculus**).
* Their goal: to create a mathematical language for curved spaces that works in any coordinate system.

---

### 5. **Einstein and General Relativity (1915)**

* **Albert Einstein** used Ricci and Levi-Civita’s tensor calculus in his theory of **General Relativity**.
* Einstein needed a way to describe **gravity as the curvature of space-time**, which varies with mass and 
  energy.
* Tensors made it possible to write the equations of gravity that work in all reference frames.

---

## 🎯 Why This History Matters

Before tensors:

* Geometry was mostly flat (Euclidean).
* Physical laws depended on the coordinate system.
* Complex systems (like rotating bodies or curved space) were hard to describe consistently.

With tensors:

* Geometry could be curved.
* Equations became **coordinate-independent**.
* Many fields like physics, engineering, and computer graphics gained a powerful new language.

---

### 🧠 In Summary

> **Tensors emerged as a unifying tool to describe quantities that have multiple directions and behave 
  predictably under coordinate changes — something vectors and scalars couldn’t fully do.**

---------------------------------------------------

# Tensors Simple Definition:

### 🧠 **Simple Definition of a Tensor (High School Level)**

A **tensor** is a mathematical object that helps describe physical quantities in a way that works in 
**any direction or coordinate system**.

You can think of it like this:

* A **scalar** (like temperature or mass) is just a number — it's the simplest kind of tensor (rank 0).
* A **vector** (like velocity or force) points in a direction — it's a rank 1 tensor.
* A **tensor** is a more general version of vectors and scalars. It can represent things like **stress**, 
  **rotation**, or **fields** in space, and it can have many directions at once (rank 2 or higher).

---

### 🔁 Why Tensors Matter

Tensors are important because they **don’t change their meaning** when you rotate or change your point of 
view. For example:

* If you describe how forces act inside a bridge using tensors, the equations stay the same no matter which 
  way you look at it.
* In physics, this makes equations like Einstein’s theory of gravity work in any frame of reference.

---

### 📦 Simple Analogy

* **Scalar**: a single number (e.g., 37°C)
* **Vector**: an arrow with a direction and size (e.g., wind blowing north at 10 km/h)
* **Tensor**: a grid or table of numbers that changes predictably with rotation, like how forces spread 
  across a surface.

# Tensors in QM and Machine learning

Tensors are used **extensively** in both **quantum physics** and **machine learning**, but in different 
ways — reflecting their flexibility and power as a mathematical tool.

---

## ⚛️ **Tensors in Quantum Physics**

In quantum physics, tensors help describe complex systems with 
    **many particles**, 
    **multiple degrees of freedom**, or 
    **entanglement**. 

Here's how:

### 1. **Quantum States as Vectors**

* A quantum state is represented as a **vector** in a complex vector space (Hilbert space).
* For example, a qubit (quantum bit) can be written as:

  $$
  |\psi\rangle = \alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle
  $$

  where $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}$, and this is a **rank-1 tensor**.

---

### 2. **Tensor Products for Multi-Particle Systems**

* When combining systems, we use the **tensor product** of Hilbert spaces:

  $$
  |\psi\rangle = |\psi_1\rangle \otimes |\psi_2\rangle
  $$
* This is how we describe **entangled** states and many-body quantum systems.
* A system of $n$ qubits lives in a space of dimension $2^n$: a high-rank tensor.

---

### 3. **Operators as Rank-2 Tensors**

* Quantum **operators** (like observables or gates) are represented by **matrices**, i.e., rank-2 tensors.
* The evolution of a quantum system involves applying operators (tensors) to state vectors.

---

### 4. **Tensor Networks**

* **Tensor network methods** (like Matrix Product States or MERA) compress huge quantum states efficiently.
* Widely used in **quantum many-body physics** and **quantum computing** simulations.

> 🔁 *In summary*, 
  tensors allow quantum physicists to model, manipulate, and simulate systems with multiple 
  quantum particles and interactions.

---

## 🤖 **Tensors in Machine Learning**

In machine learning, especially deep learning, the word **“tensor”** typically refers to 
**multi-dimensional arrays** used to store and process data and weights.

### 1. **Data as Tensors**

* Input data: images, videos, audio — all stored as **tensors**.

  * Example: A color image is a 3D tensor (Height × Width × Channels).
  * A batch of images becomes a 4D tensor (Batch × Height × Width × Channels).

---

### 2. **Model Parameters as Tensors**

* Weights in neural networks (especially CNNs or RNNs) are stored in tensors.

  * For example, in a fully connected layer:

    $$
    \text{Output} = W \cdot x + b
    $$

    where $W$ is a rank-2 tensor (matrix), and $x$ is a vector.

---

### 3. **Tensor Operations**

* Common operations:

  * **Matrix multiplication**, **dot products**, **convolution**, **reshaping**, **broadcasting**
* Frameworks like **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, and **JAX** are literally named after their focus on 
  **tensor computation**.

---

### 4. **Autograd & Backpropagation**

* Gradients are computed through **automatic differentiation**, which involves tensor operations.
* During training, the model uses **tensor calculus** (chain rule, derivatives) behind the scenes.
