# Short history of Bells theorem:

- Bells theorem is a landmark of modern science (beyong physics and intelectual sweep it has), its 
  orginally published in 6 pages. Which could be said as a very elegant and breaf article.
  ( And it rewards re-reading even today ), The paper shows that Bell was exceptional careful and 
  disciplined writer, making his assumptions as clear as possible. 
  
- The Bell's article that its talking about is the EPR paradox, EPR was about 30 years prior to this paper and 
  his article was publised late in 1964. 
  The paper is available on the public domain at the following links:
  - https://cds.cern.ch/record/111654
  - https://sengerm.github.io/html-academic-publishing/examples/1964_Bell/Bell_1964_On%20the%20Einstein%20Podolsky%20Rosen%20paradox.html
  
- In the paper John Bell was not so much concerned about QM itself but possible alternatives to QM theory.
  (Curt Jaimangal: refers here to watch the Tim Maudlin show on "Who is the QM Observer?") 
  In the language at that time used called Hidden variables. 
  So Inspired by work by people like Einstein and other architects of Quantum theory like 
  Aaron Schroinger who came to very skeptical and dissatisfied whith what we might recognize today as kind
  of ordinary or orthodox QM.

- Bell wondered was there any way to put into a Quantum like framework. A way of describing 
  or ascribing to Quantum Objects  definite properties  prior to and independent of our measurement and if so 
  could those properties also nonetherless obey what we might call kind of locality or local causality?
  Is there a way to make QM look more compatable with relativity where nothing travels faster then speed of light?
  thats the locality. And in which there are really definite properties to little bits of matter that we can 
  attribute whether we perform measurement or not. And those are guiding principles that people like Einstein 
  thought should be part of any acceptable physical theory. 
  And Bell thought those were awafully reasonable principles. 
  
- So Bell's  Wondering what would it take to develop a theory  of the micro world in which those elements held 
  hold true, where you could attribute properties to particles ahead of time before measurement and in which 
  local events yield only local outcomes, i.e Local causes yield local effects. 
  
- Looks like based on these Bells winds up formulating his very succint very elegant framework and finds that in any
  puditive theory of the micro world in which those two postulates hold, then there is a upper limit to how strongly correlated 
  the outcomes of measurements can be on any pair of particles, if they have been prepared together but since traveled apart.
  So Bells might have in mind the EPR paper, He is thinking of what is now called pairs of entangled particles, and he is 
  wondering if a theory of nature is going to have these very reasonable sounding attributes, Objects have their own properties,
  Nothing travels faster then light, Then what are the implications empirically for things like performing measurements,
  on pairs of particles that have travelled in opposite directions far apart? And Bells derives is an upper quality, that's a 
  inequality on a measure of how correlated the outcomes can be even in principle on measurements on questions we 
  might ask of each of those particles, if the theory described and obyes sort of Einstein's preferred postulates.
  Bells finds there is an upper bound and then he goes very quickly to show a now standard calculation in ordinary Quantum theory,
  that the Quantum theory predicts stronger correlations. That if you prepare particles in a particular quantum state, say a Quantum singlet state
  for two particles  a classic entabgled state and shoot those particles in opposite directions and perform measurements in  different bases 
  different choices of what to measure  on each side that for clever choices of  the quantum state  and clevel choices of the measurements 
  to be performend the outcome of those measurements can be more strongly corelated. They'll line up much more often, dramatically more often 
  then any Einstein like theory could ever allow. So that QM does not obey this conjoint pair of  postulated of basically what became known as 
  'local hidden variables'. This is amazing.
  
  Bell also said he was a theoretical physicist  but he realized this in principle something that could be measured in a laboratory. This is what 
  we now call Bell's inequality or Bell's theorems, which tells there is an upper limit to the degree of coorelation behavior of particles if they
  are obeying these local causal relationships.
  (Curt Jaimangal: suggest to look into Tim Palmer, Tim Mauldin Quantum Chaos).
  
- After this great paper many years pass an there is hardly anyone paying attention, untill an young experimental physicist John Clauser who got 
very excited at this, where he saw the implications right away. Clauser was a PHd student at that time in late 60's, but was actively discouraged
by his PHd advisor to pay any attention to this. where he disparaged as sort of mere philosophy.

- The general question or the topic of the foundations of Quantum theory generally let alone specific topics like Bell's theorem were 
  really out of favor, out of  fashion, through out the physics community, espically in US and ...Which might have to do with the intelluctual 
  trends as with institutional changes, in the way physicists were being trained coming out of world war 2. And strongly discouraged Clauser to 
  drop and finish his PHd on a different topic, and during his post-doctoral position he was very curious and went back at this question.
  And set his mind to see if one can really do an honest to goodness laboratory test of this Bell's inequality. And he was very well trained 
  experimental physicists by then, and in 1969 he writes directly to John Bell asking if there is any one who has done this experiment since
  then? And Bells replied saying that he it was the among the first questions he's gotten from any physicist in the world about this work.
  That is 4 year later, and Bell confirms that no one has done any experiment. As people did not show any interest at all and would be amazing to 
  do it. And Bell writes in a private letter to Clauser that if he finds different results from QM, that would shake the world. The stakes seemd high.
  Later on Clauser goes ahead to do the experiment with a small team of like minded people at that time.

- Bell's theorem is a mathematical theorm, which means it depends on a starting assumptions. And if those assumptions hold in real world?
  So if an experiment test, you have to show that your experiment is consistent with the starting assumptions, and just we found some results.
  And so what Bell, Clauser, and other like Abnner Shimone, and more .. in the mid 70's began to realize, and identify is there are all 
  these kind of what came to be called loopholes that have to be addressed in a  any given experiment, if we really going to conclude that the strong 
  co-relations that you presumably going to measure are because of violation of Bell's inequality. I.e to say there are all kinds of subtle, 
  sometimes weired sounding secnarios  in which a perfectly Einstein like theory perfectly consistent with local hidden variables, could 
  yield these very strong correlations. One obvious one in which Clauser and Bells wrote to each other is that if information could be flowing 
  throughtout experiment. If information could be leaking from one side of the test to the other. Say if Particle A is measured here and say some time goes by 
  so a single light signal could be traveled from here to there at the speed of light and later measure the properties of Particle B,
  then may be there is a room for coordination of the outcomes, because it was sharing of information, "I asked this question here and got this answer",
  Makes sures the other one lines up. Which is what got to be known as "locality loophole", its was very difficult to perform this experimentally
  at that time, and if we take this into account then we are not proving of violation of Bells inequality, if nonetherless find strong corelations.
  If we do not have space-time arrangement of each relevent event in your experiment. 
  
- There was other thing which Bell over looked and it was pointed out by Clauser, Abn Shimone and Michael Horn, after 12 years from Bells
  theorem, which we call today as "Freedome of choice loophole",( this also has other names but this is most common one). 
  This is not about the flow of information during an experiment did dector A messaged to dector B, But its instead it;s about shared common
  causes. Could there be any subtle influence or event that you otherwise had'nt taken into account, that could have nudged or 
  previwed the series of questions to be asked at each detector in advance, without changing what can do even if you know what  qustions will be 
  asked when and then could have communicated that in advance to the source of  entangled particles before the particles are emitted. 
  This is like getting a copy of the examination questions the night before. 
  If we know exactly the order of what questions will be asked when, then you and your twin at home because, okey this question is going to be here, 
  let's make sure the answers lineup, and they leave on the school bus stop... So there is no longer mysterious. It's consistent with 
  Einstein principles strong co-relations, If there was some flow of information not during the conduct of experiment, but from some shared cause of 
  common cause before. ( David Kaiser MIT physicist has a book on Histroy of Entanglement and Bell's theorem). 
  


Great! Let's dive deeper into **quantum entanglement** in terms of:

---

### ðŸ§® **Mathematical Foundations of Entanglement**

#### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Quantum States and Tensor Products**

When dealing with two quantum systems, A and B, their combined state is described using the **tensor product** of their individual Hilbert spaces.

For example, if:

* System A is in state $|\psi\rangle_A$,
* System B is in state $|\phi\rangle_B$,

then the combined state is:

$$
|\Psi\rangle_{AB} = |\psi\rangle_A \otimes |\phi\rangle_B
$$

This is a **separable** or **product state**, meaning there's no entanglement.

#### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Entangled States**

An **entangled state** is one that **cannot** be written as a product of individual states.

Example: One of the **Bell states**:

$$
|\Phi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|00\rangle + |11\rangle)
$$

This state is entangled because you cannot express it as:

$$
|\Phi^+\rangle \neq |\psi\rangle_A \otimes |\phi\rangle_B
$$

Measuring one qubit instantaneously collapses the state of the other.

### ðŸ”¬ **Key Properties of Entangled States**

* **Non-local correlations**: Measurement outcomes on one particle are correlated with those on the other, regardless of distance.
* **No faster-than-light communication**: Entanglement doesn't transmit usable information faster than light.
* **Violation of Bell inequalities**: Demonstrates incompatibility with local hidden variable theories.

---

### ðŸ§ª **Modern Applications of Entanglement**

#### 1. **Quantum Teleportation**

* Transmits the **state** of a quantum system from one place to another using entanglement and classical communication.
* First demonstrated in 1997 (Bouwmeester et al.).

#### 2. **Quantum Cryptography**

* **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)** protocols like **E91** (Ekert, 1991) use entanglement to guarantee secure communication.

#### 3. **Quantum Computing**

* Entangled qubits are essential for **quantum parallelism** and **speedup** in algorithms like Shor's and Grover's.

#### 4. **Quantum Networking**

* Entanglement underpins the idea of **quantum internet**, allowing distributed quantum computation and secure communications.
