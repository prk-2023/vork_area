# Vacuum Levels and Pumps 

---

Unit of measurements for pressure is a **torr**, and is defined as below:

    1 torr is defined as \( \frac{1}{760} \) of an atmosphere (atm), or approximately 133.322 pascals (Pa).

The specific *torr levels* you need for performing physics experiments depend on the type of experiment and 
the level of vacuum required. 

Here are some typical ranges of vacuum conditions used in various experiments:

### 1. **Low Vacuum (Rough Vacuum)**
    - **Pressure range:** 760 torr to 25 torr
    - Used in experiments where moderate vacuum levels are sufficient (e.g., for mechanical pumps or for 
      applications like vacuum forming or degassing).

### 2. **Medium Vacuum**
    - **Pressure range:** 25 torr to 10^-3 torr (0.001 torr)
    - Common in experiments involving gas dynamics, material science, or basic research that doesn't require 
      ultra-high vacuum conditions.

### 3. **High Vacuum**
    - **Pressure range:** 10^-3 torr to 10^-7 torr
    - Required for experiments involving electron beams, thin-film deposition, and particle accelerators.

### 4. **Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV)**
    - **Pressure range:** 10^-7 torr to 10^-12 torr
    - Necessary for precision experiments like surface science, high-energy physics, and atomic/molecular 
      research where contaminants need to be minimized to the extreme.

### 5. **Extreme High Vacuum (XHV)**
    - **Pressure range:** Below 10^-12 torr
    - Used in cutting-edge experiments such as those related to quantum mechanics or extremely sensitive 
      measurements that require near-perfect vacuum conditions.

### Common Physics Experiments and Their Torr Levels:

- **Electron Microscopy**: 
    High vacuum or ultra-high vacuum (10^-3 torr to 10^-7 torr).

- **X-ray Crystallography**: 
    High vacuum, depending on the setup.

- **Vacuum Chambers (Particle Accelerators)**: 
    Ultra-high vacuum (10^-7 torr to 10^-10 torr).

- **Surface Science (e.g., Scanning Tunneling Microscopy)**: 
    Ultra-high vacuum (UHV), typically 10^-9 torr or lower.

- **Laser Cooling and Trapping**: 
    Ultra-high vacuum (UHV), often below 10^-7 torr.

In summary, depending on your experiment, the required vacuum conditions (in torr) will vary. 
For most experiments involving electron beams, atomic-scale work, or surface studies, you'll be operating 
in the ultra-high vacuum range (10^-7 torr to 10^-12 torr). For less precise work, low to medium vacuum 
conditions might suffice.
