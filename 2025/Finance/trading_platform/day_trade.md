Q2> can rust be useful for developing the software along with python.
the idea is to create a home (small investment platform ) 
and if wish to scale bigger then what other things need to consider?

Ans> 
Yes, **Rust can be highly useful alongside Python** when you're building a small home-grown investment platform‚Äîespecially if you plan to **scale it up** later.

---

## ‚úÖ **Why Use Rust with Python?**

### üîπ Python Strengths:

* Excellent for **rapid prototyping**, **data analysis**, **backtesting**, and **machine learning**.
* Massive ecosystem: `pandas`, `NumPy`, `scikit-learn`, `TA-Lib`, `yfinance`, etc.

### üîπ Rust Strengths:

* **Performance** (faster than Python by orders of magnitude).
* **Memory safety** (no garbage collector, safe concurrency).
* Great for building **core engines**, **order matching**, **real-time data processing**, and **low-latency APIs**.

---

## üîß **How to Use Python + Rust Together**

1. **Python for high-level orchestration**, scripting, strategy logic, plotting, ML.
2. **Rust for performance-critical components**:

   * Data ingestion
   * Order book simulation
   * Backtesting engine
   * Real-time price feeds
   * Trade execution logic

### Options to Integrate:

* [`PyO3`](https://pyo3.rs): Call Rust from Python by building Python extensions in Rust.
* [`maturin`](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin): Build and distribute Python packages from Rust easily.
* Use **FFI** (foreign function interface) with `cbindgen` if you want a cleaner separation.

---

## üèó Your Investment Platform: Architecture Ideas

### üè† Home/Small Setup (MVP)

* **Backend**: Python (Django or FastAPI), or Rust (Axum or Actix-web).
* **Trading logic**: Python (early phase), later migrate to Rust if needed.
* **Data**: `yfinance`, `alpaca`, `polygon.io`, or `IEX Cloud` APIs.
* **Storage**: SQLite or PostgreSQL.
* **Dashboard/UI**: Streamlit (Python), or a simple frontend (React/Next.js).
* **Backtesting**: Python (`backtesting.py`, `bt`, `vectorbt`), or Rust for custom engine.

### üß± Scaling to a Bigger Platform

| Component              | Scaling Strategy                                                     |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Architecture**       | Move to **microservices** (Docker, Kubernetes, Rust/Python services) |
| **Storage**            | Use **PostgreSQL**, **Redis**, **Parquet**, or **TimeScaleDB**       |
| **Real-time Trading**  | Use **Kafka**, **NATS**, or **Redis Streams**                        |
| **Execution Layer**    | Rust microservice handling live orders and fills                     |
| **Backtesting Engine** | Build a Rust-native backtester or use vectorized Python (`vectorbt`) |
| **Security**           | Use secure Rust for key modules (order validation, auth)             |
| **APIs**               | REST (FastAPI/Rust) or gRPC                                          |
| **Cloud**              | AWS/GCP/Azure for scaling, monitoring, logging                       |
| **Broker APIs**        | Alpaca, Interactive Brokers, Robinhood, Binance, etc.                |

---

## üîê Advanced Topics to Consider for Scaling

* **Concurrency**: Rust's async ecosystem (e.g., `tokio`) makes high-performance real-time systems easier.
* **Compliance**: Logging, KYC/AML, and audit trails (if going public).
* **Security**: API rate limiting, auth (JWT/OAuth), key management (Vault, HSMs).
* **Monitoring**: Grafana, Prometheus, ELK stack.
* **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Docker, Cloud Run.

---

## üí° Final Thoughts

If you're just starting:

* Prototype **fully in Python**.
* Optimize with Rust **only where it makes sense** (data ingest, execution engine).
* Keep components **modular** to make migration smoother later.

If you want, I can help you sketch a basic architecture or help write an initial prototype in both Rust and Python.


Q3> trading platform should be specific to taiwan.
since there are no local or hard to find local trading platforms that offer english based service i plan to write /run my own and then scale from there

Ans> 
Yes ‚Äî Rust can be a powerful complement to Python when building your Taiwan-specific investment platform. Here's how you can combine them effectively, especially given your intent to cater to the local market with English-friendly tooling:

---

## üéØ Taiwan‚ÄëFocused Trading Infrastructure

### ‚úÖ Python Ecosystem

* **Shioaji** is a Taiwan-native trading API (from Sinopac) that is Python-friendly, Linux/Mac compatible, and used for trading stocks, futures, and options on TWSE/TPEX ([sinotrade.github.io][1]).
* For data (real-time and historical), consider:

  * **Fubon MarketData API / WebSocket** for TWSE data ([Reddit][2], [fbs.com.tw][3]).
  * **TEJ API** for rich fundamental and historical data across Taiwan and other APAC markets ([tejwin.com][4]).
  * **FinMind** for free API access to Taiwan financial data (but may lack live updates) ([tejwin.com][4]).

### ü¶Ä Rust Ecosystem

* **`twstock` crate**: fetches Taiwan Stock Exchange market data (realtime & history) directly via TWSE public API using async Rust ([Docs.rs][5]).
* Rust modules can wrap or augment API integrations (Shioaji, TEJ, FinMind, etc.) to provide a safe, high‚Äëperformance backend.

---

## üß© Architecture Blueprint: Python + Rust Hybrid Platform

### üè† MVP Stage (Home / Proof-of-Concept)

1. **Python Frontend Layer**: UI (Streamlit/Flask/FastAPI), strategy logic, orchestration, backtesting.
2. **Rust Core Services**: Data ingestion, low-latency fetch from `twstock` or Fubon WebSocket, execution logic.
3. **Integration**: Use Python calls into Rust via `PyO3` or `maturin`, also build Rust microservices with REST/gRPC endpoints.
4. **Database**: SQLite or PostgreSQL for logging trades and storing market data.

### üöÄ Scaling Stage (Local Trading Platform)

Moving toward production with full trading support:

| Concern                | Approach                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Broker Interfaces**  | Shioaji API (Python), custom Rust service wrapping order routing   |
| **Market Data**        | Fubon WebSocket or TEJ for robust historical/fundamental data      |
| **Order Management**   | Rust service for trade execution, validation, concurrency safe     |
| **Backtesting Engine** | Initially using Python; migrate performance-critical parts to Rust |
| **Frontend Web/API**   | Python API (FastAPI) with Rust-backed performance-critical calls   |
| **Security**           | Rust-based modules for auth and sensitive code; TLS, rate-limits   |
| **Cloud & DevOps**     | Docker + Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, alerting         |

---

## üåç Local Regulations & Practicalities

* **Regulatory oversight** by Taiwan Financial Supervisory Commission / SFB ‚Äî you'll need to ensure compliance with trading data licensing, user authentication, and record-keeping ([sinotrade.github.io][1], [fbs.com.tw][3], [sinotrade.github.io][6], [Wikipedia][7], [EODHD][8]).
* **Brokerage or licensing**: partnering with a Taiwanese broker (e.g. Yuanta, Cathay, Fubon) is typical for trading access; Shioaji requires an existing trading account with Sinopac ([sinotrade.github.io][1]).
* **Market rules**: TWSE minimum lot size is usually 100 shares, intraday price limits (\~7% swing) apply ([Reddit][9]).
* **Foreign user experience**: many local trading apps are Chinese-only; your English-friendly platform could fill this gap. Foreigners can open accounts with Taishin, Cathay, etc., but backend APIs often lack English documentation ([Reddit][10]).

---

## üìö Why Rust + Python Makes Sense

* **Python** is ideal for prototyping strategies, ML models, dashboarding, and using Shioaji or TEJ APIs.
* **Rust** brings:

  * High throughput for real-time price processing.
  * Memory safety & no runtime overhead.
  * Safe concurrency for data streaming and order execution.
  * Strong performance to handle scale without adding latency.

You could start purely in Python, then identify performance bottlenecks (e.g. real-time processing, heavy backtesting loops) and reimplement those parts in Rust.

---

## ‚úÖ Suggested Next Steps

1. Register with a local brokerage offering English trading API (e.g. Sinopac for Shioaji).
2. Prototype Python scripts for:

   * Fetching real-time price and historical data.
   * Simulating trades/backtesting.
3. Write a minimal Rust module using `twstock` or WebSocket to fetch real-time tick data.
4. Integrate Rust into Python via `PyO3` or REST microservice.
5. Build a simple dashboard/streaming UI in English (e.g. Flask or Streamlit).
6. Add risk controls, logging, and modular structure for future scalability.
7. Plan compliance (data licensing, user accounts, KYC, auditing).

---

### üí¨ Final Thought

Using Python as your orchestration and experimentation layer, while leveraging Rust for performance-critical, production-grade components, is a smart way to create an English-friendly Taiwan trading platform. When you're ready, I can help you sketch out code templates in both languages ‚Äî just say which part you‚Äôd like to start with (e.g. real-time data fetch, order routing, backtesting)!

Q4> 
twstock is a (crate)library for fetching data from the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) 
API, Is the TWSE API free or how can one get them

Ans> 

Yes, you *can* get data from the TWSE for free, but there are limitations depending on usage:

---

## üü¢ Free Public APIs

* The TWSE‚Äôs **Market Information System** makes **real-time (current trading) info freely available to the public** for personal use ([PyPI][1], [Taiwan Stock Exchange][2]).
* Developers commonly use unofficial endpoints such as `mis.twse.com.tw/stock/api/getStockInfo.jsp?ex_ch=...` to fetch live quotes via simple HTTP requests ([Gist][3]).

  * Example: `https://mis.twse.com.tw/stock/api/getStockInfo.jsp?ex_ch=tse_2330.tw&json=1&delay=0`

These methods work well for personal or academic projects.

---

## üî¥ Commercial & Licensed Usage

* If you're distributing data publicly (e.g., for other users or a site), TWSE requires a **formal contract and licensing fees**, even for "delayed" data ([Gist][3])
* The **Data E‚ÄëShop** offers subscription plans (e.g., EOD data, 5‚Äësecond updates) typically ranging from **NT\$300‚Äì1,500/month** for external users ([eshop.twse.com.tw][4]).

---

## üõ† Using the `twstock` Crate & Other Libraries

* The **Rust `twstock` crate** and the Python **`twse`**, **`twstock`**, or **`node-twstock`** libraries scrape these free endpoints to fetch live/delayed data ([Lib.rs][5]).
* Great for prototyping and personal use, though subject to rate limits and not officially endorsed by TWSE.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary Table

| **Use Case**                   | **Method**                        | **Cost**             |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Personal, real-time quotes     | Public API (`mis.twse.com.tw`)    | Free                 |
| Scraping via libraries         | `twstock`, `twse`, `node-twstock` | Free                 |
| Hosting data publicly          | TWSE Data E‚ÄëShop subscription     | NT\$300‚Äì1,500+/month |
| Full commercial redistribution | Formal TWSE contract & licensing  | Custom quote         |

---

## What You Should Do Next

1. **Start with free routes**:

   * For Python: `pip install twse`
   * For Rust: `cargo add twstock`
     These give you real-time and historical data for your personal project.
2. **Monitor request limits** carefully to avoid being blocked.
3. **Evaluate your data needs** once you plan to scale or share publicly:

   * If external-facing, budget for a **Data E-Shop** subscription (\~NT\$1,500/month for delayed EOD).
   * For real-time with public access, be prepared to enter a **TWSE vendor contract**.
4. **Combine data sources**:

   * You can supplement with Fubon‚Äôs WebSocket API for real-time feed ([PyPI][1], [Reddit][6], [fbs.com.tw][7], [Taiwan Stock Exchange][2], [Reddit][8], [Reddit][9], [Reddit][10], [Reddit][11]).
   * For fundamentals or deeper historical data, consider TEJ or FinMind.

Q5> scraping TWSE is legal?
Ans> 

Scraping TWSE (Taiwan Stock Exchange) data **is not officially authorized** and may **violate the terms of service** or **data usage policies** of TWSE. Here's what you should know:

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è **Is Scraping TWSE Legal?**

### ‚úÖ **Technically Possible (but not officially permitted)**

* The TWSE publishes market data via its website and APIs like `https://mis.twse.com.tw/stock/api/getStockInfo.jsp`.
* These endpoints are **not documented for public developer use** and are intended for browser-based access.
* Many libraries (e.g., `twstock` in Python or Rust) **scrape** or **simulate browser calls** to access data.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Legality Concerns**

TWSE‚Äôs **Terms of Use** (available on [twse.com.tw](https://www.twse.com.tw/en/)) generally **prohibit:**

* Unauthorized access or automated scraping.
* Republishing or redistributing data without permission.
* Commercial use of the data unless licensed.

> **Using the data for personal use (non-commercial)** may be tolerated, but **not officially allowed**, especially if you:
>
> * Send large volumes of requests.
> * Host or share the scraped data.
> * Monetize a product using it.

### üî¥ **Risks If You Scrape Without Permission**

* Your IP may be blocked.
* You may receive a cease-and-desist notice.
* Legal action (especially if data is resold or widely redistributed).

---

## ‚úÖ **Legal Alternatives**

If you want to stay compliant and build a platform with growth potential:

### 1. **Use Licensed APIs**

| Provider                 | Data Scope                | Language Support | Notes                               |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Shioaji** (Sinopac)    | Real-time quotes, trading | Python           | Requires Sinopac account            |
| **TEJ**                  | Fundamentals, prices      | RESTful API      | Paid; trusted in Taiwan             |
| **Fubon MarketData API** | Real-time & delayed TWSE  | WebSocket        | Some docs in Chinese; stable        |
| **FinMind**              | TWSE daily quotes         | Python           | Free (limited); decent for backtest |

### 2. **TWSE Data E‚ÄëShop**

* Offers end-of-day (EOD), tick-level, and institutional investor data.
* Paid, but **official and legal**.
* Great for historical analysis, data warehousing.

## üß≠ Recommendation

| If You're...                  | Do This                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Prototyping for personal use  | Use `twstock`, but limit request frequency.            |
| Building a commercial product | Get data via **Shioaji**, **TEJ**, or **Fubon APIs**.  |
| Publishing/hosting data       | Subscribe to **TWSE E-Shop** or sign a licensing deal. |

## ‚úã Bottom Line

Scraping TWSE is technically possible but **not legally safe** for long-term or public/commercial use. If you're serious about building a trading platform, it's **strongly recommended** to go through **official data sources** and **sign licensing agreements** where needed.

If you'd like help connecting to Shioaji or setting up a caching layer for legally obtained data, I can help with that too.

Q6>
help  set up a Rust service scraping TWSE, 
1. python module
2. py rust hybrid model to fetch live quotes

Ans>

Got it! Let‚Äôs set up a simple **Rust service to scrape TWSE live quotes**, and then build:

1. A **Python module** to call that Rust service.
2. A **Python + Rust hybrid** where Rust code is wrapped as a Python module using `PyO3`.

---

# Step 1: Rust Service to Scrape TWSE Live Quotes

We'll write a small Rust app that fetches live data from TWSE‚Äôs public API endpoint.

### Cargo.toml

```toml
[package]
name = "twse_scraper"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
reqwest = { version = "0.11", features = ["json", "blocking"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

### src/main.rs

```rust
use reqwest::blocking::Client;
use serde::Deserialize;

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
struct TwseResponse {
    // We'll parse the minimal fields for example
    #[serde(rename = "msgArray")]
    msg_array: Vec<TwseStock>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
struct TwseStock {
    #[serde(rename = "c")]
    code: String,
    #[serde(rename = "n")]
    name: String,
    #[serde(rename = "z")]
    price: String,
}

fn fetch_live_quote(stock_code: &str) -> Result<TwseStock, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let url = format!("https://mis.twse.com.tw/stock/api/getStockInfo.jsp?ex_ch=tse_{}.tw&json=1&delay=0", stock_code);

    let client = Client::new();
    let resp = client.get(&url).send()?.json::<TwseResponse>()?;

    if let Some(stock) = resp.msg_array.into_iter().next() {
        Ok(stock)
    } else {
        Err("No stock data found".into())
    }
}

fn main() {
    let stock_code = "2330"; // TSMC example
    match fetch_live_quote(stock_code) {
        Ok(stock) => println!("{} {} {}", stock.code, stock.name, stock.price),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Error: {}", e),
    }
}
```

**Run:**

```bash
cargo run
```

You should see TSMC‚Äôs (code 2330) latest price printed.

---

# Step 2: Python Module to Call Rust Service

We can invoke the Rust service executable from Python via `subprocess`:

```python
import subprocess
import json

def get_live_quote(stock_code):
    # Run Rust scraper with stock code argument
    result = subprocess.run(
        ['cargo', 'run', '--quiet', '--', stock_code],
        capture_output=True,
        text=True
    )
    if result.returncode != 0:
        raise Exception(f"Rust scraper error: {result.stderr}")
    output = result.stdout.strip()
    # Output format: code name price
    code, name, price = output.split(' ', 2)
    return {'code': code, 'name': name, 'price': price}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    stock = get_live_quote('2330')
    print(stock)
```

**Note:** For production, compile Rust as a binary and call that binary instead of `cargo run` to avoid overhead.

---

# Step 3: Rust + Python Hybrid Module with PyO3

This lets you call Rust functions *directly* in Python, no subprocess needed.

### Setup

Add `pyo3` and `maturin` to your Rust project:

`Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package]
name = "twse_py"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[lib]
name = "twse_py"
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
pyo3 = { version = "0.17", features = ["extension-module"] }
reqwest = { version = "0.11", features = ["json", "blocking"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
```

### src/lib.rs

```rust
use pyo3::prelude::*;
use reqwest::blocking::Client;
use serde::Deserialize;

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
struct TwseResponse {
    #[serde(rename = "msgArray")]
    msg_array: Vec<TwseStock>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
struct TwseStock {
    #[serde(rename = "c")]
    code: String,
    #[serde(rename = "n")]
    name: String,
    #[serde(rename = "z")]
    price: String,
}

#[pyfunction]
fn fetch_live_quote(stock_code: &str) -> PyResult<Option<(String, String, String)>> {
    let url = format!("https://mis.twse.com.tw/stock/api/getStockInfo.jsp?ex_ch=tse_{}.tw&json=1&delay=0", stock_code);
    let client = Client::new();

    let resp = client.get(&url).send().map_err(|e| pyo3::exceptions::PyIOError::new_err(e.to_string()))?
        .json::<TwseResponse>().map_err(|e| pyo3::exceptions::PyValueError::new_err(e.to_string()))?;

    if let Some(stock) = resp.msg_array.into_iter().next() {
        Ok(Some((stock.code, stock.name, stock.price)))
    } else {
        Ok(None)
    }
}

#[pymodule]
fn twse_py(_py: Python, m: &PyModule) -> PyResult<()> {
    m.add_function(wrap_pyfunction!(fetch_live_quote, m)?)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

---

### Build & Install

You need **maturin** to build the Python extension.

Install maturin:

```bash
pip install maturin
```

Build and install locally:

```bash
maturin develop
```

---

### Use in Python

```python
import twse_py

stock = twse_py.fetch_live_quote("2330")
if stock:
    code, name, price = stock
    print(f"{code} {name} {price}")
else:
    print("No data")
```

| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Rust scraper binary        | Fast data fetching, standalone executable    |
| 2. Python subprocess call     | Easy Python integration (slow)               |
| 3. PyO3 Rust extension module | High-performance, direct Rust-Python binding |

If you want, I can help you with:

* Making the Rust service async.
* Adding caching or retries.
* Packaging everything into Docker for easy deployment.

Just ask!
