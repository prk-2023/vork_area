# (1) the Hong Kong / China “gold infrastructure → yuan internationalization” angle, and (2) recent & broader gold market developments (as of October 1, 2025). 
---

## 1. Hong Kong / China: “Gold infrastructure as bridge to Yuan internationalization”

Chief Executive **John Lee Ka‑chiu** (often rendered “John Lee”) made a policy announcement on **September 17, 2025**, that directly addresses Hong Kong’s ambitions in the gold sector. ([People's Daily Online][1])

**Key elements of Lee’s announcement:**

* Hong Kong will **accelerate establishment of an international gold trading market**. ([People's Daily Online][1])
* The HKSAR government will support setting up **gold storage facilities**, targeting a storage capacity of **over 2,000 tonnes** within three years. ([People's Daily Online][1])
* Encourage gold traders and refineries to locate or expand in Hong Kong; also explore processing in the mainland, then shipping refined gold into Hong Kong for trading/delivery. ([People's Daily Online][1])
* Establish a **central clearing system for gold transactions** in Hong Kong (in compliance with international standards). ([People's Daily Online][1])
* Invite participation by the **Shanghai Gold Exchange** in mutual market access, effectively linking Hong Kong’s gold platform with mainland China’s systems. ([People's Daily Online][1])
* Promote new product vehicles, including **tokenised gold**, and help set up a trade association for the gold industry. ([Dimsum Daily][2])

In addition, Lee’s broader policy address also included monetary/FX‑oriented measures:

* The policy outlined efforts to **expand RMB/renminbi usage**, including promoting offshore Chinese government bonds as collateral in clearing houses, study of using yuan in SAR government spending, and making it easier to trade the yuan against other regional currencies. ([China Daily][3])
* Hong Kong already plays a central role in offshore renminbi business, and the gold market ambitions are seen as complementary to that status. ([South China Morning Post][4])

**Interpretation & significance (in light of your framework):**

The announcement fits quite squarely into the narrative you outlined: using gold infrastructure to bolster the credibility and reach of the yuan (renminbi) as an international currency. Some key inference points:

* By building up physical gold storage and trading capacity in Hong Kong, the Chinese / HKSAR authorities are creating one of the nodes of a gold‑based (or gold‑anchored) platform that supports global settlement or backing functions.
* The mutual market access with Shanghai suggests that Hong Kong might act as a bridge between mainland and offshore gold markets, potentially allowing yuan‑denominated gold trading or settlement that straddles the onshore/offshore divide.
* Tokenised gold and new financial products indicate a desire to integrate gold with fintech / blockchain / digital assets, which could bolster the “trust / transparency” dimension that the yuan currently lacks globally.
* The scale target (2,000 tonnes) is substantial (though over 3 years) — if achieved, this gives Hong Kong meaningful heft as a gold hub.

So yes, this is plausibly a **milestone** in China’s broader push to reshape the monetary landscape (i.e. “de‑dollarization + yuan internationalization + gold as anchor or trust lever”).

Caveats / risks:

* Execution risk is high: building vaults, clearing systems, regulatory frameworks, trust, international participation—all take time.
* Whether foreign investors / central banks will treat these structures as credible depends on legal, regulatory, and political transparency.
* The yuan still faces questions of exchange rate stability, capital controls, and geopolitical trust issues; gold infrastructure is a necessary but not sufficient lever.

If you like, I can try to pull up analysis from commodity / FX strategists on how they view this HK move in the context of de-dollarization and yuan policy.

## 2. Gold market & macro environment (as of Oct 1, 2025)

Here’s where the gold market stands, and what seems to be driving it:

### Recent price & market moves

* On **October 1, 2025**, gold prices hit **all‑time highs**, with spot gold rising past **$3,800/oz**. ([Reuters][5])
* The dollar has weakened, and markets are pricing in strong odds of U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, which support a non‑yielding asset like gold. ([Reuters][6])
* Safe haven demand is robust amid macro and geopolitical uncertainty (e.g., U.S. government shutdown risk, soft economic data). ([Reuters][6])
* The rise is also being supported by inflows into gold ETFs and central bank purchases. ([Reuters][5])

### Outlook & forecasts

* **UBS** recently raised its forecast to **$3,800/oz** by end‑2025 and further to **$3,900** by mid‑2026, citing weaker dollar and rate cut expectations. ([Reuters][7])
* The **World Gold Council (WGC)** sees gold prices potentially rising up to **15%** from current levels in a bullish scenario, though its base case is more moderate upside. ([Business Standard][8])
* Analysts often view central bank demand, ETF flows, and the interest rate trajectory as key drivers.
* Some forecasts remain more conservative (e.g. from banks) depending on risks (inflation surprises, dollar rebound, policy shocks).

### Broader structural themes & risks

* The role of **central banks** remains central: many emerging / non‑dollar countries continue to accumulate gold as a reserve diversification strategy.
* Gold’s rising rank in official reserves: in some reports, gold has overtaken the euro to become the second largest reserve asset after the U.S. dollar (though by how strictly “reserve asset” is measured may vary). ([Financial Times][9])
* Supply constraints: gold mining, capital expenditures, and ore grades will increasingly matter over time (but not necessarily binding in the short term).
* Risks include: a resilient U.S. economy (forcing higher rates), stronger dollar, regulatory shocks, or a loss of investor confidence in gold’s rally.

# Role of Singapore:

Here’s what I found on **Singapore**’s recent role vis‑à‑vis gold infrastructure, gold trading, and how it might play into broader themes like yuan internationalization or de‑dollarization. I’ll also point out uncertainties / gaps. If you want, I can try to track any internal policy announcements in Singapore that mirror Hong Kong’s Sept 17 move (vaults, gold‑clearing, RMB link etc).

---

## What Singapore is doing — key developments

1. **Gold storage & vaulting capacity (“The Reserve”)**

   * Singapore has built a facility called *The Reserve*, near Changi Airport, which is a high‑security storage/vault facility for precious metals. ([Financial Times][1])
   * Capacity is large: about **500 tonnes** of gold + **10,000 tonnes** of silver. ([Cryptopolitan][2])
   * However, utilization is still low — as of late 2025, much of that capacity remains empty. ([Financial Times][1])

2. **Investor demand / physical gold trend**

   * Surge in demand from ultra‑wealthy individuals for storage of physical gold/silver in Singapore. “The Reserve” saw ~**88% increase** in orders for storage in early 2025 vs same period in 2024; bar & bullion sales rose ~200%. ([CNBC][3])
   * Local investor demand also increased: in Q1 2025, Singapore investors bought **2.5 tonnes** of bullion (bars/coins), up ~35% year‑on‑year. This was the highest quarterly demand since records began (2010). ([Business Times][4])

3. **Regulatory, tax, and institutional frameworks**

   * Singapore has removed Goods & Services Tax (GST) on investment‑grade precious metals (this has been in place for some time). ([CNBC][5])
   * Approved Refinery & Consolidator Scheme (ARCS) that allows refiners / consolidators to import materials destined for refinement into investment‑grade precious metals with favorable tax/tariff treatment. ([Singapore Bullion Market Association][6])
   * A major LBMA‑accredited refinery (Metalor) has been established in Singapore, strengthening its refining capacity. ([Singapore Bullion Market Association][6])

4. **New gold futures / contracts**

   * There is a new “physical gold contract” initiative from a Singapore‑based exchange (Abaxx Exchange) aiming to challenge London/New York dominance: a **one‑kilogram, physically deliverable gold futures contract** deliverable within Singapore. ([Financial Times][7])
   * Other market participants are discussing new “kilobar” type contracts, purity standards etc., and there’s demand for Asia‑based price discovery/gold products. ([The Edge Malaysia][8])

5. **International cooperation / RMB / China link**

   * Singapore’s Temasek issued *offshore renminbi bonds* (multi‑tranche, 5‑, 10‑, 30‑year) using several banks. That shows the state investor is active in the RMB market. ([The Star][9])
   * MAS / Singapore has strengthened cooperation with China, including via financial / capital markets / green finance initiatives. E.g., Singapore‑China MoU (with UOB and Shanghai Gold Exchange) to cooperate in proprietary trading, physical delivery of gold products, and to provide “innovative services to ASEAN gold suppliers and investors.” ([Hubbis][10])

## Where Singapore aligns / diverges with the “Gold → Yuan internationalization” model

Given your framework (Hong Kong builds gold infrastructure as bridge for yuan internationalization), here are how Singapore’s moves map, and what’s missing / less evident.

| Aspect                                                                   | Singapore’s strength / current activity                                                                                                                                                                                  | Less evidence / potential gaps                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Physical gold infrastructure (vaults, refineries, storage, delivery)** | Strong: The Reserve; LBMA refinery; tax‐friendly import/refinement schemes. Singapore is positioning itself as a secure, trusted vaulting hub. ([Singapore Bullion Market Association][6])                               | Utilization has lagged; scale is high but connecting that infrastructure into broader monetary anchor systems (e.g. gold‑backed yuan contracts) is less visible so far.                                                                                                           |
| **Gold trading / contracts**                                             | New contracts being launched (Abaxx); discussions about kilobar contracts; physical delivery offerings. ([Financial Times][7])                                                                                           | Fewer signals that contracts are being offered in or convertible to yuan / renminbi; most products still USD‑denominated or not explicitly RMB linked. Also, price discovery / clearing in yuan is more nascent.                                                                  |
| **RMB / China integration**                                              | Some cooperation (MoUs, RMB bond issuance, etc. by state entities) shows Singapore is engaging in RMB finance. Also proximity to Asia‐based demand, institutions, and being a neutral jurisdiction helps. ([Hubbis][10]) | But there’s no clear Singapore government announcement (as of what I saw) about developing gold contracts settled in RMB or linking gold vaults to yuan clearing the same way Hong Kong is pushing. Not yet a fully articulated “gold‑backed yuan” infrastructure from Singapore. |
| **Regulatory / trust / stability aspects**                               | Very strong: Singapore has political stability, well‑regulated financial and logistics sectors; tax incentives; strong legal framework. That attracts investors / ultra‑wealthy looking for secure storage. ([CNBC][3])  | Political neutrality is double‐edged: while trust is high, Singapore is not part of China structurally; there might be limits in how deeply it ties into Chinese initiatives if it wants to maintain its non‑aligned, neutral‑hub status.                                         |

## Implications & possible roles Singapore might play

Putting together what's happening, Singapore could serve several complementary roles in a de‑dollarization + gold + yuan internationalization landscape:

1. **Neutral vaulting and trust location**

   * Because many investors, especially ultra‑wealthy, are seeking secure vaults in jurisdictions not heavily exposed to geopolitics, Singapore is attractive. This gives it leverage: physical gold stored there could be used as collateral, backing, or reference reserves by entities that want some distance from China but still engage in Asian / yuan markets.

2. **Alternative / supplementary price discovery / contract venue for Asia**

   * With the Abaxx contract, kilobar discussions, Singapore is building the components of an Asian eastern center for bullion & futures trading. Over time this could reduce dependence on London & New York, which is part of the de‑dollarization/displacement story.

3. **RMB / China‑partnered financial products**

   * Singapore already has RMB bond issuance, and cooperation with Chinese exchanges. Those could evolve into yuan‑denominated or yuan‑settled gold products, or mutually recognized delivery chains (vaults, clearing) involving Singapore and China.

4. **Competition / complement to Hong Kong**

   * Hong Kong is pursuing aggressive integration with mainland China for RMB / gold infrastructure (vaults, clearing, contracts). Singapore likely sees itself both as complementary (serving different market segments, more neutral; perhaps more attractive to non‑Chinese / international investors) and as a competitor (for being the Asian hub for bullion / trade / contracts).

---

## What is less clear / what to watch out for

* Whether Singapore will itself adopt or issue **gold contracts directly denominated in renminbi** (or with RMB settlement) at scale. That seems more in Hong Kong’s immediate road map.

* Whether Singapore’s government or regulators will make specific policy pronouncements to target yuan internationalization (via gold) — similar to Hong Kong’s “2,000 tonne storage target + gold market link with Shanghai” announcement.

* Whether Singapore will become a clearing / settlement hub for RMB‑denominated bullion contracts: i.e. whether foreign users can settle gold trades via yuan through Singapore vaults or contracts.

* The speed at which infrastructure utilization and liquidity spreads enough—just having physical capacity or contracts is one thing; getting market participants (including central banks, large traders) to use them is another.

---

## Recent published articles & sense of momentum

* A *Financial Times* piece (“Singapore and Hong Kong go for gold …”) (Sep 29, 2025) describes Singapore’s ambitions as intensifying, especially in vaulting, refining, gold futures contracts. It notes capacity is high in Singapore’s vaults but that much remains unused. ([Financial Times][1])
* Another article cites “Singapore seeks to rival London and New York with new gold contract” (the Abaxx one) which signals serious intent. ([Financial Times][7])

If you like, I can try to find any recent internal Singapore government policy speech (in the last weeks or months) akin to Hong Kong’s 17 September speech, to see if Singapore is formally laying out a roadmap for gold → yuan. Do you want me to check that?
