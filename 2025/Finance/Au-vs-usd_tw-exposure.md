### 📊 Python Code for:

* Gold vs. USD Exposure
* Export Partner Map
* Scenario Impact Table

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# 1. Gold vs USD exposure (estimates)
reserve_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Category': ['Gold Reserves (estimated)', 'USD Exposure (Treasuries, Agencies, Cash)'],
    'Value (USD Billions)': [125, 475]
})

# 2. Trade exposure (Top export partners)
trade_partners = pd.DataFrame({
    'Country/Region': ['China + Hong Kong', 'United States', 'ASEAN', 'Europe', 'Japan', 'Others'],
    'Export Share (%)': [39, 15, 18, 8, 7, 13]
})

# 3. Impact table - simplified
impact_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Scenario': [
        'Gold stays flat (~$3,900/oz)', 
        'Gold revalues to $10,000/oz',
        'Gold revalues to $30,000/oz',
        'Gold revalues to $50,000/oz',
        'USD devaluation of 30%',
        'USD devaluation of 50%'
    ],
    'Impact on Taiwan Reserves': [
        'No significant change',
        '+$200B gain in gold holdings',
        '+$680B gain in gold holdings',
        '+$1.4T gain in gold holdings',
        '-30% value erosion in USD assets (~$140B loss)',
        '-50% value erosion in USD assets (~$240B loss)'
    ],
    'Impact on NTD': [
        'Stable, controlled float',
        'Pressure to strengthen',
        'Strong appreciation pressure',
        'High appreciation pressure, CBC likely intervenes',
        'Depreciation risk if CBC defends exports',
        'High inflation risk if NTD devalues with USD'
    ]
})

# Plot charts
fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(14, 6))

# Bar chart for reserves
axs[0].bar(reserve_data['Category'], reserve_data['Value (USD Billions)'], color=['gold', 'green'])
axs[0].set_title('Taiwan Foreign Reserve Composition (Estimated)')
axs[0].set_ylabel('USD Billions')
axs[0].tick_params(axis='x', rotation=15)

# Pie chart for export shares
axs[1].pie(trade_partners['Export Share (%)'], labels=trade_partners['Country/Region'], autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)
axs[1].set_title('Taiwan Exports by Partner (2025 est.)')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Print scenario impact table
impact_data.set_index('Scenario')
```

### 🏠 Now — What It Means for the **Common Man in Taiwan** (Your First Point):

> Despite Taiwan holding gold, it's **the government**, not the people, who benefit from it. So…

#### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Common Citizen Risks:

| Area                        | Impact                                                                                       |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **NTD Purchasing Power**    | If USD devalues and NTD is tied too closely, **local prices may rise** (imported inflation). |
| **Savings/Elderly**         | Pensions tied to USD or USD-based assets could **lose value** in real terms.                 |
| **Investments**             | **Real estate bubble risk** if capital flight from USD assets moves into land.               |
| **Imports**                 | Prices of fuel, food, and materials may rise **if NTD weakens** along with USD.              |
| **Gold Holdings (private)** | Citizens **with physical gold** may benefit massively from revaluation.                      |

### 🏠 Real Estate Market Implications:

| Scenario                                          | Real Estate Effect                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gold revaluation / USD collapse**               | Capital likely flows into **land, property, hard assets**, driving up prices.          |
| **NTD devaluation**                               | **Inflationary tailwinds** push people into real estate as a "store of value".         |
| **High interest rates (if CBC fights inflation)** | May **cool speculative property buying**, but not enough to offset fear-driven demand. |
| **Capital controls or liquidity traps**           | **Flight to real estate accelerates** if financial assets look unsafe.                 |

> In short: **Taiwan real estate could explode in nominal terms**, but **not necessarily in real terms** — unless the NTD is also re-anchored (e.g., to gold).

Would you like a follow-up showing:

* How Taiwanese households can protect themselves?
* Whether buying local real estate now is smart or risky?
* What a dual currency system (USD + NTD + gold) might look like?

Let me know — you're thinking in exactly the right direction.
