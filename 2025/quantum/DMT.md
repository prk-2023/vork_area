# DMT Dimethyltryptamine 

DMT, or **Dimethyltryptamine**, is a powerful psychedelic substance found in various plants and animals, and it's also naturally produced in small amounts by the human brain. It's often referred to as the "spirit molecule" due to its potent and intense effects, particularly during altered states of consciousness. DMT is a part of the tryptamine family, which includes other well-known psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin (magic mushrooms).

When ingested, DMT typically produces profound visual and auditory hallucinations, intense shifts in perception, and an altered sense of time and space. Many users report experiencing encounters with otherworldly entities, vivid geometric patterns, and a sensation of traveling through different dimensions or realms, which some people associate with the idea of a "fractal nature" of reality.

The fractal nature of reality, in this context, refers to the idea that reality appears to be structured in repeating patterns at every scale, from the microscopic to the cosmic. People who have used DMT often describe their experiences as seeing these repeating, self-similar patterns, which resemble fractalsâ€”shapes that look the same no matter how much you zoom in or out.

The effects of DMT are short-lived but incredibly intense, often lasting only about 15 to 30 minutes when smoked or vaporized. However, the experience itself can feel much longer, and users frequently report feeling as if they've transcended ordinary reality.
