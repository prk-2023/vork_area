# Electro magnetic Induction ( Classical and Quantum explanation)

thinking:
The classical explanation for electromagnetic induction. 
Wait, that seems a bit contradictory. Let me parse this again.

Looking back, the user's previous question was: "how do we explain electro magnetic induction from
quantum physics. 
What makes electricity in a coil when there is a change in magnetic field." 
And I explained the quantum perspective. 
Now they want the classical explanation of that quantum explanation. Or 
perhaps they meant to ask for the classical explanation versus the quantum one again, but phrased it awkwardly.

Alternatively, maybe they want a comparison between classical and quantum explanations. 
The user could be a student trying to reconcile both viewpoints. 
The phrasing "classical explanation of the Quantum explanation" is unclear. 
Maybe they want to understand how the classical theory (Faraday's Law) relates to the quantum explanation 
I provided earlier.

To be safe, I should provide both explanations again, clearly distinguishing them, and perhaps address how 
they connect. 
The user might be seeking a side-by-side comparison to better grasp the differences and similarities. 
Let me structure the response by first restating the classical explanation (Faraday's Law) and then the 
quantum explanation (vector potential, Aharonov-Bohm effect, phase shifts), highlighting the key differences
and why the quantum view is necessary. 
Also, mention that while classical works for most cases, quantum provides a deeper understanding, 
especially in scenarios where potentials have observable effects even when fields are zero. 
Make sure to use simple terms and analogies where possible to aid comprehension

A **classical explanation** of electromagnetic induction (Faraday’s Law) alongside the 
**quantum explanation**, highlighting their key differences and connections:

---

### **Classical Explanation (Faraday’s Law of Induction)**

**What Happens?**  
When a magnetic field through a coil changes (e.g., moving a magnet in or out), it induces an 
**electromotive force (EMF)** in the coil, creating a current.  

**Key Idea (Fields and Forces):**  
- A changing magnetic flux $(\( \Phi_B \))$ creates a circulating **electric field** $(\( \mathbf{E} \))$ 
  in the coil.  

- This electric field exerts a force on electrons in the conductor, causing them to move (current).  

**Equation (Faraday’s Law):**  
$$
\[
\mathcal{E} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}, \quad \text{where } \Phi_B = \int \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{A}.
\]
$$

**Mechanism:**  

- The motion of the magnet (or change in field strength) alters the magnetic flux through the coil.  
- The induced EMF drives electrons to flow in the coil, obeying $\( \mathcal{E} = IR \)$ (Ohm’s Law).  

**Example:**  

Moving a bar magnet into a coil generates a current in the coil (as seen in generators or transformers).  

---

### **Quantum Explanation (Phase Dynamics and Potentials)**  

**What Happens?**  
At the quantum level, the changing magnetic field modifies the **vector potential $(\( \mathbf{A} \))$ **, 
which directly affects electrons’ quantum states, inducing current.  

**Key Idea (Wave Functions and Phases):**  

1. **Vector Potential $(\( \mathbf{A} \))$ Dominates:**  
   
   - Quantum mechanics treats $\( \mathbf{A} \)$ (not just $\( \mathbf{B} \)$ ) as fundamental. 
     The Hamiltonian of an electron depends on $\( \mathbf{A} \)$:  
     $$
     \[
     H = \frac{1}{2m} \left( \mathbf{p} - q\mathbf{A} \right)^2.
     \]
     $$

2. **Phase Shift in Electrons:**  

   - Electrons in the coil acquire a **quantum phase** proportional to the line integral of $\( \mathbf{A} \)$:  
     $$
     \[
     \Delta \phi = \frac{q}{\hbar} \oint \mathbf{A} \cdot d\mathbf{l}.
     \]  
     $$

   - A changing $\( \mathbf{A} \)$ (due to changing $\( \mathbf{B} \)$ ) creates a time-varying phase 
     gradient along the coil.  

3. **Current as a Phase Adjustment:**  

   - To maintain a single-valued wave function (no discontinuities), electrons redistribute their momentum, 
     creating a **net current**.  

**Equation (Aharonov-Bohm Effect):**  
$$
\[
\mathcal{E} = -\frac{d}{dt} \oint \mathbf{A} \cdot d\mathbf{l}.
\]
$$
**Mechanism:**  
- Even if $\( \mathbf{B} = 0 \)$ in the region of the coil (but $\( \mathbf{A} \neq 0 \)$ ), a 
  changing $\( \mathbf{A} \)$ can induce current.  

- The phase gradient $\( \nabla \phi \)$ acts like an effective electric field 
  ( $\( \mathbf{E} = -\nabla \phi \)$ ), accelerating electrons.  

**Example:**  
In superconducting rings, quantized magnetic flux ( $\( \Phi = n \frac{h}{2e} \)$ ) arises purely from the 
phase coherence of electrons.

### **Key Differences**  
| **Aspect**               | **Classical**                          | **Quantum**                                         |  
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|  
| **Primary Actor**         | Magnetic field ($\( \mathbf{B} \)$)      | Vector potential ($\( \mathbf{A} \)$)            |  
| **Mechanism**             | Electric field exerts force on charges | Phase gradient in wave functions drives current    |  
| **Role of Fields**        | \( \mathbf{E} \) and \( \mathbf{B} \)  | $\( \mathbf{A} \)$ is fundamental; fields derived  |  
| **Non-Local Effects**     | No (local fields)                      | Yes (Aharonov-Bohm effect)                         |  

---

### **Why Both Are Needed**  
1. **Classical**: Explains everyday induction (generators, transformers) using intuitive fields and forces.  
2. **Quantum**:  
   - Explains phenomena where $\( \mathbf{A} \)$ has observable effects even when $\( \mathbf{B} = 0 \)$ (Aharonov-Bohm effect).  
   - Accounts for superconductivity and persistent currents in quantum systems.  

---

### **Connecting the Two**  
- **Faraday’s Law** is a **macroscopic approximation** of the quantum phase dynamics.  
- The classical $\( \mathbf{E} \)$ -field corresponds to the quantum phase gradient ( $\( \mathbf{E} = -\nabla \phi \)$ ).
- Both frameworks agree in classical limits but diverge in quantum regimes.  

---

### **Summary**  
- **Classical**: “A changing magnetic field creates an electric field that pushes electrons.”  
- **Quantum**: “A changing vector potential alters electrons’ quantum phases, forcing them to redistribute as current.”  

The quantum explanation is more fundamental, but the classical view works perfectly for most engineering applications. 
Together, they reveal how electromagnetism spans scales from power grids to subatomic particles!

## Case II: ( **Quantum Explanation of Electromagnetic Induction in a Coil** )
Q. Explain electro magnetic induction from quantum view.
   ( What makes electricity in a coil when there is a change in magnetic field. )

```markdown
Thinking:

Okay, so I need to explain electromagnetic induction from a quantum physics perspective, specifically why 
electricity is generated in a coil when there's a change in the magnetic field. Let me start by recalling
what I know about electromagnetic induction from classical physics. Faraday's Law says that a changing
magnetic field induces an electromotive force (EMF) in a coil, which causes a current if the circuit is
closed. But how does this work at the quantum level?

First, I remember that in classical terms, the EMF is due to the movement of electrons in the coil when
the magnetic flux changes. But quantum physics deals with particles like electrons as wave functions and
involves their interactions with electromagnetic fields. So maybe I need to think about how electrons in 
the conductor respond to changes in the magnetic field.

In quantum mechanics, electrons in a conductor are in delocalized states, forming a Fermi sea. When the 
magnetic field changes, it affects the vector potential, which in quantum mechanics is part of the
Hamiltonian that determines the electron's behavior. The Aharonov-Bohm effect comes to mind, where a
vector potential can influence electrons even in regions where the magnetic field is zero. 
That might be related here.

Wait, the vector potential plays a role in the phase of the electron's wave function. When the magnetic 
flux through a loop changes, the vector potential's line integral around the loop changes, leading to a
phase shift in the electron's wave function. This phase shift could induce an electromotive force. But how
does that translate to a current?

Also, in quantum mechanics, the electric field is related to the time derivative of the vector potential.
So if the magnetic field (and thus the vector potential) changes over time, there's an electric field
created. This electric field would exert a force on the electrons, causing them to move, which is the 
induced current. But this seems similar to the classical explanation. How does quantum theory differ here?

Maybe the key is in how the electrons' quantum states adjust to the changing vector potential. 
The electrons' momentum in quantum mechanics includes a term from the vector potential 
(canonical momentum vs. kinetic momentum). So when the vector potential changes, the canonical momentum
changes, leading to a change in the electrons' motion.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to structure this:

1. **Classical vs. Quantum View**: In classical physics, changing B induces E, which pushes electrons. 
   In quantum physics, the vector potential A is fundamental, and changes in A affect the electrons'
   wave functions.

2. **Aharonov-Bohm Effect**: Demonstrates that the vector potential (not just the fields) has physical 
  significance. Electrons encircling a region with changing A acquire a phase shift, leading to observable
  effects.

3. **Electron Response in a Conductor**: The electrons in the conductor are in quantum states. 
   A changing A modifies their Hamiltonian, leading to a shift in their momentum and thus a current.

4. **Quantization and Persistent Currents**: In superconducting loops, quantum effects lead to persistent 
  currents when magnetic flux is quantized. Maybe this is an example of quantum electromagnetic induction.

Wait, but the user asked about regular coils, not superconductors. So perhaps even in normal conductors, 
the quantum behavior of electrons responding to the vector potential via their wave functions leads to the
induced EMF.

Another angle: The Lorentz force in quantum terms. The electrons experience a force due to the electric
field generated by the time-varying vector potential. In quantum mechanics, the electric field is related 
to the gradient of the scalar potential and the time derivative of the vector potential. So a time-varying
A creates an E-field, which accelerates the electrons.

But how is this different from the classical explanation? Maybe the quantum explanation provides a more
fundamental reason rooted in the interactions of the electron wave functions with the electromagnetic 
potentials, rather than just the fields.

Also, considering the role of the gauge symmetry. Electromagnetic potentials are subject to gauge 
transformations, but physical observables (like the induced EMF) depend on gauge-invariant quantities,
such as the magnetic flux.

So putting it all together: When the magnetic flux through a coil changes, the vector potential around th
e coil changes. This change affects the phase of the electrons' wave functions in the conductor.
The requirement for the wave function to be single-valued (leading to quantized flux in superconductors)
means that a changing flux induces a phase gradient along the coil, which corresponds to an electromotive
force. The electrons respond to this EMF by moving, creating a current.
i
But I need to make sure this is accurate. Let me check some concepts:

- **Gauge Invariance**: The physical effects depend on the integral of the vector potential around a loop
(magnetic flux), which is gauge-invariant.

- **London Equations in Superconductors**: Describe how the superconducting current responds to 
electromagnetic fields. The phase of the superconducting wave function is related to the vector potential.

But in normal conductors, electrons are not in a coherent quantum state. However, each electron's wave
function is still influenced by the vector potential. The collective effect of all electrons responding 
to the changing A leads to the induced current.

So the quantum explanation would involve each electron's wave function acquiring a phase shift due to
the time-dependent vector potential, leading to a net movement of electrons (current) in the coil.

But how does this phase shift translate to a physical current? In the Aharonov-Bohm effect, the phase
shift leads to interference patterns, but in a conductor, maybe the phase gradient along the wire due 
to changing A creates an effective electric field that drives the current.

Yes, the time derivative of the vector potential contributes to the electric field, E = -∇φ - ∂A/∂t. 
So even if there's no scalar potential gradient (∇φ=0), a time-varying A creates an E-field. 
This E-field accelerates the electrons, leading to current.

But in quantum terms, the Hamiltonian for an electron in an electromagnetic field is 
H = (1/2m)(p - qA)^2 + qφ. So the vector potential A directly affects the electron's momentum.
A time-dependent A would lead to a time-dependent Hamiltonian, causing the electrons to adjust their
momentum, resulting in current.

Therefore, quantum mechanically, the changing magnetic field (through the vector potential A) modifies the
electrons' momentum operators, leading to a net current in the coil. This is the quantum basis for
Faraday's Law of induction.

I think this makes sense. The key difference from the classical view is the explicit role of the vector
potential and the quantum mechanical treatment of electron momentum. The induced EMF arises because the
electrons' wave functions must adjust to the changing A, resulting in a collective motion that we observe 
as current.

**Quantum Explanation of Electromagnetic Induction in a Coil**

When a magnetic field changes through a coil, inducing an electric current, the process can be 
understood quantum mechanically through the interplay of electrons' wave functions and electromagnetic 
potentials. 

Here's a structured explanation:

---

### **1. Role of the Vector Potential (A)**

In quantum mechanics, the **vector potential $\( \mathbf{A} \)$** (not just the magnetic field $\( \mathbf{B} \)$ ) 
directly influences charged particles like electrons. The Hamiltonian for an electron in an electromagnetic field is:
$$
\[
H = \frac{1}{2m} \left( \mathbf{p} - q\mathbf{A} \right)^2 + q\phi,
\]
$$
where $\( \mathbf{p} \)$ is the canonical momentum, $\( q \)$ is the electron charge, and $\( \phi \)$
is the scalar potential. The term $\( \mathbf{p} - q\mathbf{A} \)$  represents the **kinetic momentum**.

---

### **2. Time-Dependent Vector Potential**

When the magnetic flux through the coil changes (e.g., moving a magnet), the vector potential $\( \mathbf{A} \)$ 
becomes time-dependent. This modifies the Hamiltonian, altering the electrons' quantum states. 
The time derivative of \( \mathbf{A} \) generates an **electric field**:

$$
\[
\mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{A}}{\partial t} \quad \text{(in the absence of a scalar potential gradient)}.
\]
$$
---

### **3. Phase Shift and the Aharonov-Bohm Effect**

- Electrons traveling around a loop acquire a **quantum phase** proportional to the line integral of $\( \mathbf{A} \)$:
  $$
  \[
  \Delta \phi = \frac{q}{\hbar} \oint \mathbf{A} \cdot d\mathbf{l}.
  \]
  $$

- A changing $\( \mathbf{A} \)$ (and thus changing flux $\( \Phi = \oint \mathbf{A} \cdot d\mathbf{l} \)$ ) 
  causes a time-dependent phase shift in the electrons' wave functions. 
  This phase gradient along the coil corresponds to an **electromotive force (EMF)**.

---

### **4. Electron Response in the Conductor**
- The phase shift disrupts the equilibrium of electrons in the conductor. 
  To maintain consistency (single-valued wave functions), electrons adjust their momentum, leading to a
  **net current**.

- Quantum mechanically, the induced electric field $\( \mathbf{E} = -\partial \mathbf{A}/\partial t \)$ 
  accelerates electrons, causing collective motion (current).

---

### **5. Connection to Faraday’s Law**
- The quantum perspective aligns with Faraday’s Law $(\( \mathcal{E} = -d\Phi/dt \)$ ) but explains it 
through **wave function phase dynamics** rather than classical forces.
- The EMF arises from the requirement that the total phase change around the loop must account for the 
changing flux, enforcing consistency in the quantum state.

---

### **6. Key Differences from Classical Explanation**
- **Vector Potential Primacy**: Quantum mechanics treats $\( \mathbf{A} \)$ (not just $\( \mathbf{B} \)$ )
  as fundamental.

- **Phase-Driven Current**: The current results from phase coherence in electron wave functions, not just 
  Lorentz forces.

- **Gauge Invariance**: Physical effects depend on gauge-invariant quantities like magnetic flux $(\( \Phi \))$,
  not the specific choice of $\( \mathbf{A} \)$.

---

### **Example: Superconducting Rings**
In superconductors, flux quantization occurs:
$$
\[
\Phi = n \frac{h}{2e},
\]
$$
where $\( n \)$ is an integer. A changing flux induces persistent currents to maintain quantized flux, a 
purely quantum effect.

---

### **Summary**
- **Quantum Mechanism**: 
  A changing magnetic flux alters the vector potential $\( \mathbf{A} \)$, inducing a phase gradient in 
  electrons’ wave functions.

- **Result**: 
  Electrons reorganize their motion to offset the phase gradient, creating measurable current (EMF).

- **Unification**: 
  This bridges classical electromagnetism (Faraday’s Law) and quantum theory, emphasizing the role of 
  $\( \mathbf{A} \)$ and wave function coherence.

By understanding electromagnetic induction through quantum mechanics, we see how macroscopic phenomena like 
generator currents emerge from the microscopic behavior of electrons governed by quantum principles.
