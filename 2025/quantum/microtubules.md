# MicroTubules: 

The idea that **microtubules** in the brain are central to consciousness was proposed by **Roger Penrose**, 
a renowned physicist, in collaboration with **Stuart Hameroff**, an anesthesiologist. 

They developed the **Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch-OR)** theory, which suggests that consciousness 
arises from quantum processes occurring in the microtubules of neurons.

Penrose's involvement stemmed from his interest in the limits of classical physics and his belief that 
consciousness couldn't be fully explained by conventional, deterministic processes such as those in classical 
computing or AI artificial intelligence. 

He argued that quantum mechanics might play a key role in conscious experience, and microtubules, which are 
structures within neurons, could be the site where these quantum effects occur.

Stuart Hameroff, with his background in neuroscience and anesthesiology, contributed the idea that 
microtubules are the likely location for these quantum computations. 

The Orch-OR theory suggests that consciousness arises from quantum computations within the brain's 
microtubules, potentially explaining the "non-computational" and subjective aspects of conscious experience 
that seem beyond the reach of classical AI.

This theory was proposed in part to challenge the idea that consciousness can be fully replicated or 
understood purely through artificial intelligence and classical computational methods, which are based on 
algorithms and classical physics. 

The Orch-OR theory provides an alternative, more quantum-mechanical explanation for human consciousness that 
doesnâ€™t rely solely on computation in the traditional sense.
