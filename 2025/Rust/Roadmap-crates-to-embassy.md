# Rust Roadmap to Embassy.

Great question! It touches on a subtle but important distinction in how Rust uses the term **crate** versus the more traditional **library**.

---

### üîπ Rust *does* have libraries ‚Äî but it calls them **crates**.

The key is in terminology:

* **Crate** = the *unit of compilation* in Rust.
* **Library crate** = a crate that compiles to a `.rlib` or `.so`/`.dll`/`.dylib` ‚Äî in other words, a reusable **library**.
* **Binary crate** = a crate that compiles to an executable (`main` function).

So, when people say "Rust doesn‚Äôt have libraries," what they usually mean is:

> "Rust doesn‚Äôt use a separate *language construct* called ‚Äòlibrary‚Äô like some other languages do (e.g., C++ or Java). Instead, it uses crates ‚Äî and some of those crates *are* libraries."

---

### üß± Then why is `std` called the **Standard Library**?

Because functionally, that‚Äôs exactly what it is ‚Äî even though it's a **crate** named `std`, it's a *library crate* that provides:

* Core data structures (`Vec`, `String`, `HashMap`)
* Traits like `Iterator`, `Read`, `Write`
* OS abstractions (files, threads, networking)
* Memory management tools, synchronization, and more

So in practice:

> `std` is the crate that implements **Rust's Standard Library** ‚Äî it's *called* a crate, but it *acts* as a library.

---

### üí° Summary

* Rust **does** have the concept of libraries ‚Äî they are just **library crates**.
* The `std` crate **is** the Rust Standard Library.
* The naming reflects the architecture: Rust doesn‚Äôt need a separate "library" concept because **crates are general-purpose building blocks** that can be binaries, libraries, or both.

Let me know if you'd like a visual breakdown of how this all fits together.


---------------------------------------------------------------

Yes ‚Äî that‚Äôs a very solid and smart approach to learning Rust effectively. Here's how your strategy breaks down and why it works:

---

### ‚úÖ Step 1: **Learn the core language constructs**

Before you touch the `std` crate in-depth, make sure you have a handle on:

* **Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes** (this is Rust‚Äôs biggest difference from other languages)
* **Basic types and control flow** (`let`, `if`, `match`, `loop`, etc.)
* **Pattern matching** (`match`, `if let`, `while let`)
* **Functions, structs, enums, and traits**
* **Error handling** (`Result`, `Option`, `?` operator)

At this stage, you're mostly using the **core language features** and some `std` features *by necessity* (like `Vec`, `Option`, etc.), but not diving deep yet.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: **Master the `std` crate (Standard Library)**

Once you‚Äôre comfortable with Rust‚Äôs syntax and system-level thinking, **mastering the `std` crate** gives you powerful tools for real-world development.

Key areas of the `std` crate to focus on:

| Area                     | Topics                                                    |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Collections**          | `Vec`, `HashMap`, `HashSet`, `VecDeque`, `BTreeMap`, etc. |
| **Strings & Text**       | `String`, `&str`, `format!`, string conversions           |
| **Error handling**       | `Result`, `Option`, `Box<dyn Error>`, custom errors       |
| **IO and Files**         | `std::fs`, `std::io`, reading/writing files, buffering    |
| **Concurrency**          | `std::thread`, `std::sync::{Mutex, Arc}`, channels        |
| **Time & Duration**      | `std::time::{Instant, Duration}`                          |
| **Path and Environment** | `std::path::Path`, `std::env`                             |
| **Macros**               | `println!`, `format!`, `vec!`, `dbg!`, etc.               |
| **Smart Pointers**       | `Box`, `Rc`, `Arc`, `RefCell`                             |

At this point, you're building more robust programs and truly unlocking the power of Rust.

---

### ‚õ≥ Bonus Step: Learn **Crate Ecosystem** beyond `std`

The standard library is powerful, but Rust thrives on its external crates. Eventually you‚Äôll want to explore:

* `serde` (serialization)
* `tokio` or `async-std` (async programming)
* `reqwest` (HTTP client)
* `clap` or `structopt` (CLI argument parsing)
* `rayon` (parallelism)
* `anyhow` and `thiserror` (error handling)

But none of that makes sense if you're not fluent in the core language and `std` first.

---

### üéØ TL;DR Strategy

1. **Master core language concepts**
2. **Master the standard library (`std`)**
3. **Explore external crates for more advanced or domain-specific needs**

This sequence keeps the learning curve manageable while helping you build a deep, practical understanding of Rust.

Let me know if you'd like a roadmap or resource guide for each step!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes ‚Äî before diving into **[Embassy](https://embassy.dev/)** (Rust‚Äôs async embedded framework), there are a few important areas you‚Äôll want to touch up on to avoid frustration. Embedded Rust (especially async embedded with Embassy) has a steeper learning curve than desktop Rust, so preparation matters.

Here‚Äôs a practical roadmap to make sure you're well-prepared:

---

## ‚úÖ Pre-requisites Before Learning **Embassy (Async Embedded Rust)**

### 1. ‚úÖ **Solid Core Rust Skills**

You should already be comfortable with:

* Ownership, borrowing, lifetimes
* Traits and trait bounds
* Enums, pattern matching (`match`, `if let`)
* `Result`, `Option`, and error handling
* Macros (`println!`, `vec!`, etc.)
* Modules and crate structure

This is **non-negotiable** ‚Äî you‚Äôll be managing hardware, where mistakes can crash your MCU or silently break things.

---

### 2. ‚úÖ **Good Knowledge of the `std` and `core` crates**

Embedded Rust usually **doesn't use `std`** (because there's no OS), so you rely on:

* [`core`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/): subset of `std`, no heap, no OS
* [`alloc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/alloc/): dynamic memory (only if your MCU has a heap)
* You should be comfortable doing things **without a standard library** ‚Äî `#![no_std]`.

So practice:

* Writing simple no\_std apps
* Using types like `core::fmt`, `core::result::Result`, `core::str`, etc.

---

### 3. ‚úÖ **Understand Embedded Concepts**

Rust is **not** hiding the hardware from you ‚Äî quite the opposite. You‚Äôll be working with:

| Concept                              | Why It Matters                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| MCU architecture (e.g. ARM Cortex-M) | Embassy supports STM32, nRF, RP2040, etc.          |
| Interrupts & ISRs                    | async in Embassy uses interrupt-driven timers      |
| Memory-mapped registers              | You interact with peripherals directly             |
| GPIO, UART, SPI, I2C, timers, etc.   | You‚Äôll control these using HAL crates              |
| Power modes and timing               | Important for embedded performance and correctness |

You don‚Äôt need to be an EE expert, but some embedded fundamentals are crucial.

---

### 4. ‚úÖ **Familiarity with `async` / `await` in Rust**

Embassy is **async-first**, so you should understand:

* `async fn`, `.await`
* Futures and `poll`
* Pinning (at least at a conceptual level)
* `no_std` async runtimes (like `embassy-executor`)

It's not the same as async in web servers ‚Äî it's cooperative multitasking **without threads**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't learn async Rust *in the context of embedded* for the first time ‚Äî try it on the desktop with `tokio` or `async-std` first.

---

### 5. ‚úÖ **Tooling: Cross Compilation + Debugging**

You must get comfortable with:

| Tool                                    | Why                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `cargo` + `rustup`                      | Rust build and toolchain manager     |
| `probe-rs`, `cargo-embed`, or `openocd` | Flash firmware to MCU                |
| `cargo build --target`                  | Cross-compiling for microcontrollers |
| `gdb`, `defmt`, or RTT                  | Logging and debugging embedded code  |
| `cargo generate`                        | To scaffold embedded projects        |

This setup is a pain at first ‚Äî but once working, it‚Äôs stable and powerful.

---

### 6. ‚úÖ **Hardware Abstraction Layers (HALs)**

You‚Äôll often write code against:

* `embedded-hal`: common traits for GPIO, UART, SPI, etc.
* A specific MCU HAL, like:

  * `stm32f4xx-hal`
  * `nrf-hal`
  * `rp2040-hal`

These HALs give you safe, high-level access to peripherals (built on top of device-specific register maps called PACs).

You don‚Äôt need to go deep into PACs right away, but know they exist.

---

## üß≠ When to Start Embassy?

**Start Embassy when:**

* You are comfortable writing `no_std` Rust
* You understand async and embedded concurrency
* You have a dev board in hand (e.g. STM32, nRF52, RP2040)
* You want cooperative multitasking with low overhead
