Great question â€” the structure you've got is already strong and practical, but if we're thinking about **completeness** and **real-world relevance**, here are a few **additional topics** that could enrich the sequence, especially for advanced users or deeper system-level understanding:

---

## ðŸ”§ **Suggested Additional Topics**

### **9. Cache Coherency and Synchronization**
- 9.1 CPUâ€“device memory coherency
- 9.2 Cache flush and invalidate (e.g., `__builtin___clear_cache()`)
- 9.3 Memory barriers (`dmb`, `dsb`, `isb` on ARM)
- 9.4 Synchronizing DMA with CPU (e.g., `dma_sync_*` APIs)

**Why it matters:** Ensures correctness when both the CPU and a device access the same memory.

---

### **10. Memory Attributes and Page Table Flags**
- 10.1 Memory types in ARMv8: Normal, Device, Strongly Ordered
- 10.2 Setting memory attributes via page tables (kernel perspective)
- 10.3 Mapping non-cache memory using `mmap()` and `io_remap_pfn_range()`

**Why it matters:** Explains how the kernel marks memory as non-cacheable and why some addresses behave differently.

---

### **11. Low-Level memcpy() Implementations**
- 11.1 How libc (e.g., `musl`, `glibc`) implements `memcpy()`
- 11.2 Platform-specific tuning (e.g., `memcpy` on AArch64 vs x86_64)
- 11.3 Memcpy micro-optimizations (e.g., `rep movsb`, prefetching, loop unrolling)

**Why it matters:** Helps understand what's under the hood and when to override or avoid `memcpy()`.

---

### **12. Advanced eBPF Use for Memory Profiling**
- 12.1 Using `kprobes` and `tracepoints` on memory subsystems
- 12.2 Tracking DMA/map memory use with `bpf_map`, `kfunc`, etc.
- 12.3 Correlating memory events with syscall timing and performance

**Why it matters:** Adds observability for memory issues in live systems with zero intrusion.

---

### **13. Security and Stability Implications**
- 13.1 Buffer overflows and memcpy safety
- 13.2 Spectre/Meltdown effects on memory access patterns
- 13.3 Use of `memcpy()` in kernel exploits or ROP chains

**Why it matters:** Shows the intersection between performance and security.
