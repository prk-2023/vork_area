# Rust Type determination:

Rust determines a variable’s data type primarily through *type inference*, which allows you to write clean
code without always explicitly stating types. 

--> However, the compiler uses context and a few rules to make this decision. <-- 

Here's how it works:

---

### 1. Default Inference Based on Literal

If you assign a literal value to a variable without a type annotation, Rust will try to infer the type from 
the value *and the context*.

```rust
let x = 5;
```

* `5` is an integer literal. By default, Rust infers `i32` unless context suggests another integer type.

---

### 2. Contextual Inference

If a variable is used in a way that requires a specific type, Rust will infer that type.

```rust
let x = 5;
let y: u64 = x; // now Rust knows x must be something convertible to u64
```

* Here, `x` must be an integer that can be used as a `u64`, so Rust will adjust inference accordingly.

---

### 3. Method and Function Usage

Rust can infer types based on which methods or functions are called.

```rust
let v = Vec::new(); // What type of vector?

v.push(1); // Now Rust infers v is Vec<i32>
```

* The `push` method call provides type context, so Rust infers `Vec<i32>`.

---

### 4. Type Annotations Take Priority

If you explicitly annotate the type, Rust uses your instruction, regardless of the inferred type.

```rust
let x: u8 = 5; // x is explicitly a u8
```

---

### 5. Unresolvable Ambiguity Causes an Error

If there's not enough context, the compiler will give an error:

```rust
let v = Vec::new(); // ERROR if you never use v in a way that shows the type
```

Rust needs to know what kind of elements the vector will hold.

---

### 6. Float Defaults

Without context, floating-point literals default to `f64`:

```rust
let pi = 3.14; // inferred as f64
```

---

### Summary: Inference Decision Order

1. Look for type annotations.
2. Use context from surrounding code (functions, method calls).
3. Apply default types (`i32`, `f64`) if no other hints exist.
4. If ambiguity remains, compiler error.

=> When in Ambiguity: If the value could be interpreted as multiple types, like a number without a decimal, 
   you might need to clarify using a type annotation, although Rust often defaults to i32.

=> Specific Type Requirement: If you need a specific type regardless of the value, you should explicitly 
   declare it, especially if there's potential for unexpected behavior with the default type inference.

=> Parsing: When parsing strings into numbers, you often need to explicitly specify the target type because 
   the compiler cannot guess what type you want.

    ```
    let x = 5;         // Type inference: x is inferred as i32
    let y: f64 = 3.14; // Explicit type annotation: y is a f64
    let z: i32 = 10;   // Explicit type annotation: z is a i32
    ```


## *more complex examples* of Rust’s type inference 

See how type inference, behaves when there's ambiguity or deeper context.

---

## Example 1: Inferring from Method Calls

```rust
let mut numbers = Vec::new(); 
numbers.push(10);
```

### What's going on?

* `Vec::new()` alone doesn't give the compiler enough to know what type of vector to create (`Vec<T>` is generic).
* But when you call `numbers.push(10)`, the compiler knows `10` is an `i32` by default, so:

  ```rust
  numbers: Vec<i32>
  ```
---

## Example 2: Using Generic Functions

```rust
fn square<T: std::ops::Mul<Output = T> + Copy>(x: T) -> T {
    x * x
}
let result = square(3.0);
```

### Inference:

* Generic function square takes a value x of any type T and returns its square. 
  The type T must implement the Mul trait (for multiplication) with its output also being T, 
  and the "Copy trait" (because x is used twice in x * x).

* The function is generic (`T`), and it uses multiplication.
* :std::ops::Mul<Output = T> + Copy: 
    This is a trait bound. 
    It specifies the requirements that any type T must satisfy in order to be used with this 
    square function.

* std::ops::Mul: 
    This is a trait in Rust's std lib that defines the behavior of the multiplication operator 
    (*).
* <Output = T>: 
    This is an associated type within the Mul trait. 
    The output of the multiplication operation (x * x) must also be of the same type T. 
    For example, multiplying two f64 values results in an f64.

* + Copy: This is another trait bound. 
    The Copy trait indicates that values of type T can be duplicated simply by copying their 
      bits. necessary because in the expression x * x, the value of x is used twice. 
    If T were a type that implements Drop (like a String or Vec), x would be moved on the first 
      use, making the 2nd use invalid. By requiring Copy, we ensure that x is implicitly copied
      for each use.
* (x: T):
    This defines the function parameter. 
    x is the name of the parameter, and its type is T (the generic type defined earlier).

Square function takes a type argument and it can be multiplied by itself, and the result of 
that multiplication is also of the same type T. 
This is handled by the std::ops::Mul<Output = T> trait bound.

It is a Copy type => means that the value can be duplicated simply by copying its bits,
which is essential because the x value is used multiple times in the x * x expression. 
Primitive types like integers (i32, u64) and floating-point numbers (f32, f64) satisfy both 
these requirements, making them suitable for use with this square function.

---

## Example 3: Ambiguous Types without Context

```rust
let x = "42".parse();
```

### Problem:

* `str::parse` returns a `Result<T, _>`, but the type `T` isn’t specified.
* Compiler throws an error: *"cannot infer type for type parameter `T` in the function call"*.
* The expression "42".parse() attempts to convert the string "42" into an i32.
  Since "42" is a valid integer, the parsing will succeed.


You have to help it:

```rust
let x: Result<i32, _> = "42".parse();
```

Or:

```rust
let x = "42".parse::<i32>();
```

Or:

```rust 
let ten: u32 = "10".parse().unwrap(); //unwrap is the method on Result that quickly extracts
                                      //the successful value from Result ( or Option ).
```

---

## Example 4: Type Cascading from One Variable to Another

```rust
let a = 5;         // Defaults to i32
let b = a + 2u8;   // Error: mismatched types
```

### Why?

* `a` defaults to `i32`, `2u8` is a `u8`.
* Rust doesn’t implicitly cast integer types — you must be explicit.

Fix:

```rust
let a = 5u8;
let b = a + 2u8;
```

Now both are `u8`, and inference works.

---

## Example 5: Closures and Type Inference

```rust
let add = |x, y| x + y;
let result = add(1, 2);
```

* The compiler infers `x` and `y` are `i32` because of how the closure is used.
* If you never use the closure, its types remain ambiguous.

```rust
let add = |x, y| x + y; // Without usage, compiler can't infer x and y
```

Error: *"cannot infer type of the parameters of this closure"*.
NOTE: 
    Closures are Anonymous functions :
    - Closures don't have a name like regular functions. They are defined inline using |...| { ... } syntax.
    - They can capture variables from its surrounding scope. 
    - They are similar to regular functions but can access variables outside their own scope, making them
      more versatile for certain tasks like callbacks or when dealing with iterators.
    - Flexibility: They are often used in situations where you need to pass a small, self-contained piece of
      code as an argument to another function, such as with iterators or callbacks. 

---

## Summary of Where It Gets Tricky

| Situation                         | Does inference work?          |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Literal assignment                | (yes) (uses defaults)         |
| Method calls on known types       | (yes)                         |
| Generic functions without context | (no)                          |
| Complex closures                  | (no) unless usage gives hints |
| Conflicting integer types         | (no) unless cast or specified |

---

##  infers types with *structs*, *enums*, and *traits* 

"struct" "enum" and "traits"  often come with generics and associated types. 
This usually involves a bit more complexity but follows the same core inference principles.

---

## 1. Type Inference with Structs

Imagine you have a generic struct:

```rust
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}
```

### Example 1: Direct instantiation with explicit types

```rust
let p1 = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };  // What’s `T` here?
```

* Both `5` and `10` are integer literals → default to `i32`.
* So `T = i32` and `p1` is `Point<i32>`.

---

### Example 2: Mixed types cause an error

```rust
let p2 = Point { x: 5, y: 10.0 }; // error
```

* `5` is `i32`, `10.0` is `f64`.
* Rust can’t infer a single `T` that works for both fields.
* You need explicit type conversion or annotations.

---

### Example 3: Explicit annotation

```rust
let p3: Point<f64> = Point { x: 5.0, y: 10.0 };
```

* You specify `T = f64` explicitly.

---

## 2. Type Inference with Enums

Consider an enum that’s generic over some type:

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}
```

---

### Example 1: Inference with variant usage

```rust
let maybe_num = Some(42);
```

* `42` is `i32`, so compiler infers `maybe_num` as `Option<i32>`.

---

### Example 2: Ambiguity with `None`

```rust
let nothing = None;
```

* This won’t compile because Rust can’t infer what type `None` refers to.
* You must help it:

```rust
let nothing: Option<i32> = None;
```

Or use it later in a context where the type is known.

---

## 3. Type Inference with Traits and Trait Objects

### Traits with Generics

```rust
fn print_it<T: std::fmt::Display>(item: T) {
    println!("{}", item);
}

print_it(123);    // `T` inferred as `i32`
print_it("hello"); // `T` inferred as `&str`
```

---

### Trait Objects and Type Inference

If you want to store something that implements a trait but the concrete type isn’t known:

```rust
let obj: &dyn std::fmt::Display = &42;
```

* You must annotate the type explicitly, because trait objects erase the concrete type.
NOTE: Traits:
    - Traits are a way to define shared behavior across different types. 
    - They are similar to interfaces in other languages, but with added flexibility. 
    - Traits allow you to specify methods(impl) that a type must implement, enabling 
      polymorphism and abstracting over behavior.  
    - Shared Behavior: Traits define a set of methods that multiple types can implement. 
    - Abstraction: Allow you to work with types generically, without knowing their specific 
      concrete type, as long as they implement the required trait. 
    - Implementation: You can implement a trait for a specific type using the impl keyword 
      followed by the trait name and the type. 

---

## 4. Example: Combining Structs, Enums, and Traits

```rust
trait Shape {
    fn area(&self) -> f64;
}

struct Circle {
    radius: f64,
}

impl Shape for Circle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        3.14 * self.radius * self.radius
    }
}

fn print_area(s: &dyn Shape) {
    println!("Area: {}", s.area());
}

let c = Circle { radius: 5.0 };
print_area(&c);
```

* Here, Rust infers concrete types (`Circle`) and works with trait objects (`&dyn Shape`) thanks to explicit 
  annotations.

---

## TL;DR

* Rust infers generic types in *structs/enums* from the values assigned or the context they’re used in.
* *Mixed types* inside generics usually cause inference errors.
* *Enums like `None`* require explicit typing or context to infer.
* For *traits*, Rust infers generic parameters from usage, but needs explicit annotations when dealing with trait objects.

---
## ToDo: workout problems:

Concise examples for structs, enums, and traits:

---

### Structs

```rust
struct Point<T> { x: T, y: T }

let p1 = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };      // Point<i32>
let p2 = Point { x: 5.0, y: 10.0 };  // Point<f64>
let p3: Point<f64> = Point { x: 5f64, y: 10f64 };  // explicit T = f64
```

---

### Enums

```rust
enum Option<T> { Some(T), None }

let a = Some(42);           // Option<i32>
let b: Option<f64> = None;  // needs explicit type
```

---

### Traits

```rust
fn print<T: std::fmt::Display>(val: T) {
    println!("{}", val);
}

print(123);        // T = i32
print("hello");    // T = &str

let obj: &dyn std::fmt::Display = &42; // explicit trait object type
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# types:

In Rust, *understanding data types is crucial*, especially because the language emphasizes *safety*, 
*ownership*, and *performance*. 

A list of *very important data types*  to learn, to become effective in Rust:

---

### *1. Scalar Types*

These represent single values.

| Type         | Description              | Example                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| `i32`, `i64` | Signed integers          | `let x: i32 = -5;`       |
| `u32`, `u64` | Unsigned integers        | `let x: u64 = 42;`       |
| `f32`, `f64` | Floating point numbers   | `let x: f64 = 3.14;`     |
| `bool`       | Boolean values           | `let flag: bool = true;` |
| `char`       | Single Unicode character | `let c: char = '💡';`    |

Basic building blocks of all computations.

---

### *2. Compound Types*

Group multiple values together.

| Type    | Description                         | Example                        |
| ------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `tuple` | Fixed-size heterogeneous collection | `let t = (42, "hello", true);` |
| `array` | Fixed-size homogeneous collection   | `let a = [1, 2, 3];`           |
| `slice` | View into part of an array          | `let s = &a[0..2];`            |

Used for function returns, passing multiple values, working with collections.

---

### *3. `String` and `&str`*

For handling text.

| Type     | Description                    | Example                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `String` | Growable heap-allocated string | `let mut s = String::from("hi");` |
| `&str`   | String slice (borrowed)        | `let slice: &str = "hello";`      |

Rust’s string system is powerful but can be tricky due to ownership and borrowing.

---

### *4. References and Pointers*

| Type     | Description                       | Example                     |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `&T`     | Immutable reference               | `let r: &i32 = &x;`         |
| `&mut T` | Mutable reference                 | `let r: &mut i32 = &mut x;` |
| `Box<T>` | Smart pointer for heap allocation | `let b = Box::new(5);`      |

Central to Rust's ownership and borrowing model.

---

### *5. Collections (from `std::collections`)*

| Type            | Description                         | Example                         |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `Vec<T>`        | Growable array (vector)             | `let v = vec![1, 2, 3];`        |
| `HashMap<K, V>` | Key-value store (like dictionaries) | `let mut map = HashMap::new();` |
| `HashSet<T>`    | Unordered unique collection         | `let mut set = HashSet::new();` |

Real-world programs rely heavily on dynamic collections.

---

### *6. `Option<T>` and `Result<T, E>` (Enums)*

Used for *error handling* and *nullable values*.

| Type           | Description                 | Example                                |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `Option<T>`    | Represents `Some` or `None` | `let x: Option<i32> = Some(5);`        |
| `Result<T, E>` | Represents `Ok` or `Err`    | `let r: Result<i32, String> = Ok(42);` |

Replaces nulls and exceptions—core to Rust’s safety.

`Option` and `Result` are equivalent of `try-catch` from languages in Py is *pattern matching* on the 
`Result` and `Option` types, often using `match`, `if let`, or the `?` operator. 

Note: 
    Rust does not have exceptions in the traditional sense; 
    instead, it uses these enums to represent recoverable and unrecoverable errors.

---

### *7. Structs and Enums*

Your own custom data types.

| Type     | Description                              | Example                           |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `struct` | Custom types with named fields           | `struct Point { x: i32, y: i32 }` |
| `enum`   | Type that can be one of several variants | `enum Color { Red, Green, Blue }` |

Used in nearly every non-trivial Rust program.

---

### *8. Traits*

Define shared behavior.

| Type    | Description                  | Example                              |
| ------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `trait` | Similar to interfaces in OOP | `trait Drawable { fn draw(&self); }` |

Foundation for polymorphism and generic programming.

---

### Learning Priority (Suggested Order)

1. Scalars (`i32`, `bool`, `f64`, `char`)
2. Strings (`String`, `&str`)
3. References (`&T`, `&mut T`)
4. `Option<T>` and `Result<T, E>`
5. Vectors and slices (`Vec<T>`, `&[T]`)
6. Structs and enums
7. Traits and generics
8. Collections (`HashMap`, `HashSet`)
9. Smart pointers (`Box<T>`, `Rc<T>`, `RefCell<T>`)
---

# Intrinsic and Special Types:
---

## *1. Intrinsic & Other Special Types*

These are low-level or special types not often used in day-to-day Rust, but critical for systems programming.

### a. `!` (Never Type)

* Represents a function that *never returns*.
* Used for functions that panic or loop forever.

```rust
fn never_returns() -> ! {
    panic!("This function never returns!");
}
```

### b. `()` (Unit Type)

* Represents *no value* / void return.
* Commonly used in functions that don’t return anything.

```rust
fn log() -> () {
    println!("This returns nothing");
}
```

### c. Raw Pointers (`*const T`, `*mut T`)

* Unsafe, used in FFI (foreign function interfaces), low-level memory manipulation.

```rust
let x = 42;
let r: *const i32 = &x as *const i32;
```

* Must be dereferenced in an `unsafe` block.

---

## 2. Defining Custom Types

You’ve seen `struct`, `enum`, and `trait`, but here’s how to fully define and use them:

### a. Structs

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

let p = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
```

### b. Tuple Structs

```rust
struct Color(u8, u8, u8);

let red = Color(255, 0, 0);
```

### c. Enums with Data

```rust
enum Shape {
    Circle(f64),
    Rectangle { width: f64, height: f64 },
}
```

---

## 3. Casting Between Types

Use the `as` keyword to cast:

```rust
let x: i32 = 10;
let y = x as f64;
```

But *beware of lossy conversion*. Example:

```rust
let a: u8 = 255;
let b = a as char; // Valid but not obvious behavior
```

More advanced casting can use:

* `TryFrom` / `TryInto`
* `From` / `Into`

Example:

```rust
use std::convert::TryFrom;

let n: i16 = i16::try_from(256).unwrap(); // panics if invalid
```

---

## 4. Type Conversion

### a. `From` and `Into`

```rust
let s: String = String::from("hello");
let s2: String = "world".into(); // Auto conversion
```

You can implement it on your own types:

```rust
struct MyInt(i32);

impl From<i32> for MyInt {
    fn from(item: i32) -> Self {
        MyInt(item)
    }
}
```

### b. `TryFrom` and `TryInto`

Used for *fallible conversions*.

```rust
use std::convert::TryFrom;

let x = i8::try_from(150); // Ok(150)
let y = i8::try_from(300); // Err(...)
```

---

## 5. Memory View & Layout (Mental Model)

### Stack vs Heap:

| Feature | Stack                        | Heap                              |
| ------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Speed   | Fast                         | Slower                            |
| Size    | Fixed                        | Growable                          |
| Use     | Primitive values, local vars | Dynamic data like `String`, `Vec` |

### Ownership and Allocation:

```rust
let a = 5;           // stored on stack
let b = Box::new(5); // stored on heap, `b` is a pointer on the stack
```

### Memory Layout for Struct:

```rust
struct Demo {
    a: u8,     // 1 byte
    b: u32,    // 4 bytes
}
// Likely 8 bytes due to alignment padding
```

Check size with:

```rust
use std::mem::size_of;
println!("{}", size_of::<Demo>());
```

### Alignment, Padding & `#[repr(C)]`

* `#[repr(C)]` makes layout predictable (used in FFI).
* Otherwise, Rust may rearrange fields for optimal padding.

---

## 6. Type Inference & Type Annotations

Rust infers types where possible:

```rust
let x = 42; // inferred as i32
```

You can (and sometimes must) annotate:

```rust
let y: f64 = 3.14;
```

---

## Optional Advanced Concepts You Might Want Next:

* `Rc<T>`, `Arc<T>` (shared ownership)
* `RefCell<T>`, `Cell<T>` (interior mutability)
* `PhantomData`, lifetimes & variance
* Unsafe code: `unsafe`, `transmute`, inline assembly
* Zero-cost abstractions (what Rust optimizes away)

----------------------------
# Advanced Internal on Types: more on *memory rep*, *lifetimes* and *FFI and raw pointers* : 


*memory*, *lifetimes*, and *FFI/raw pointers*. 
These are the systems-level topics that give Rust its *performance edge* while maintaining safety (where possible).

---

## 1. Memory Representation in Rust

Rust offers *fine-grained control* over how data is laid out and accessed in memory.

### Stack vs Heap (Deep Dive)

| Location| Usage                               | Alloc/Dealloc         | Typical Use                           |
| ------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| *Stack* | Local vars, function params/returns | Auto (RAII)           | Scalars, fixed-size types             |
| *Heap*  | Dynamic memory (`Box`, `Vec`, etc.) | Manual via smart ptrs | Strings, collections, dynamic structs |

```rust
fn example() {
    let a = 10;                  // Stored on stack
    let b = Box::new(20);        // Pointer on stack → data on heap
}
```

### Memory Layout: Structs and Alignment

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Example {
    a: u8,
    b: u32,
}
```

Even though `u8` is 1 byte and `u32` is 4 bytes, due to *alignment padding*, the size is likely *8 bytes*:

```rust
use std::mem::size_of;
println!("{}", size_of::<Example>()); // likely 8
```

#### Fix layout with `#[repr(C)]`:

```rust
#[repr(C)]
struct CLayout {
    a: u8,
    b: u32,
}
```

> Used in FFI to ensure predictable layout like in C.

---

## 2. Lifetimes (Memory Safety Without GC)

Lifetimes ensure references *never outlive* the data they point to.

### a. Simple Example

```rust
fn longest<'a>(a: &'a str, b: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if a.len() > b.len() { a } else { b }
}
```

* `'a` means: *both inputs and the output must live at least as long as `'a`*.

### b. Lifetime Elision Rules (When You Don’t Need to Write Them)

Rust can *infer lifetimes* in simple cases:

```rust
fn get_first(s: &str) -> &str { &s[0..1] }
```

No need to annotate – Rust knows `&str` lives long enough.

---

## 3. Interior Mutability & Shared Ownership

### a. `RefCell<T>` (Single-threaded)

Allows mutation through a shared reference *at runtime*:

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;

let data = RefCell::new(42);
*data.borrow_mut() = 100;
```

Violates typical borrowing rules but enforced at *runtime*.

### b. `Rc<T>` and `Arc<T>` (Reference Counting)

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;

let shared = Rc::new(vec![1, 2, 3]);
let a = shared.clone();
```

> `Rc<T>` for single-threaded, `Arc<T>` for multithreaded (atomic).

---

## 4. Unsafe Code, Raw Pointers, and FFI

Rust provides an *escape hatch* via `unsafe`.

### a. Raw Pointers

```rust
let x = 5;
let r1: *const i32 = &x;
let r2: *mut i32 = &mut x as *mut i32;

unsafe {
    println!("{}", *r1);
}
```

> Can't be dereferenced unless inside an `unsafe` block.

### b. FFI (Calling C from Rust)

```rust
extern "C" {
    fn abs(input: i32) -> i32;
}

fn main() {
    unsafe {
        println!("{}", abs(-5));
    }
}
```

Compile with `rustc` and link against libc if needed.

### c. Exporting Rust to C

```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}
```

Compile to static/dynamic lib:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

---

## 5. Viewing and Debugging Memory

### `std::mem` Tools:

```rust
use std::mem::{size_of, align_of};

println!("Size: {}", size_of::<i32>());
println!("Align: {}", align_of::<f64>());
```

### Hex Dump of Struct:

```rust
use std::mem;

#[repr(C)]
struct Demo {
    a: u8,
    b: u32,
}

let d = Demo { a: 1, b: 0x12345678 };
let bytes: &[u8; 8] = unsafe { mem::transmute(&d) };
println!("{:x?}", bytes);
```

# Rust for Systems Programming, Embedded, and Blockchain

Rust is *perfectly positioned* for this, and you’re diving into the right topics.

Here’s a structured roadmap tailored to these domains:
---

## 1. SYSTEMS PROGRAMMING (Modern C Replacement)

### Core Concepts You Must Master

| Concept                | Why It Matters                                                  |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `unsafe`               | Required to manipulate raw memory, FFI, and bypass borrow rules |
| Custom allocators      | Build zero-cost memory management strategies                    |
| Lifetimes + ownership  | Enforce safety without garbage collection                       |
| Manual memory layout   | Control how structs are aligned, packed, and represented        |
| FFI + `#[repr(C)]`     | Interface with C, other langs or system libraries               |
| Concurrency primitives | Build lock-free, thread-safe code                               |

### Practical System Use Cases

* Writing an OS kernel (like [tock](https://www.tockos.org/))
* Memory-mapped I/O
* Network stack implementation (zero-copy)
* Filesystems, drivers, allocators

---

## 2. EMBEDDED DEVELOPMENT (No OS, no `std`)

### Core Concepts

| Concept              | Why It Matters                                        |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `no_std`             | Run without the standard library or allocator         |
| `#![no_main]`        | Use a custom entry point for bare metal               |
| `volatile`, `atomic` | Interact with memory-mapped hardware registers safely |
| `cortex-m`, `riscv`  | Common platforms where Rust is growing fast           |
| Interrupt handlers   | Handle timer/IO/ADC/etc. safely via Rust abstractions |

### Embedded-Specific Tools

* `embedded-hal` (abstraction for GPIO/SPI/I2C/etc.)
* `cortex-m-rt` (runtime for ARM Cortex-M)
* `defmt`, `probe-rs`, `RTIC` (debugging, tracing, concurrency)
* `panic-halt` or `panic-abort` (no unwinding)

### Example: Accessing Hardware Register

```rust
let reg = 0x4000_0000 as *mut u32;
unsafe {
    core::ptr::write_volatile(reg, 0xDEADBEEF);
}
```

---

## 3. BLOCKCHAIN / CRYPTO SYSTEMS

### Critical Requirements

| Concept                   | Why It Matters                                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| No GC / deterministic     | Blockchain smart contracts or nodes can't tolerate GC delays |
| Memory predictability     | Gas costs, WASM size, storage usage — all need precision     |
| Cryptographic correctness | Unsafe math = major security flaw                            |
| WASM support              | Many blockchains compile Rust contracts to WASM              |
| Serialization             | Storage, Merkle trees, signatures, etc.                      |

### Recommended Crates / Skills

* \[`no_std`] for smart contracts
* \[`wasm-bindgen`] or \[`ink!`] (for Substrate smart contracts)
* \[`serde`, `scale-codec`] for encoding data
* `blake2`, `sha2`, `ed25519-dalek`, `curve25519-dalek` for crypto
* `subxt` or `ethers-rs` for blockchain clients

### Example: Writing a WASM Contract (ink!)

```rust
#[ink(storage)]
pub struct MyToken {
    total_supply: Balance,
}

#[ink(message)]
pub fn total_supply(&self) -> Balance {
    self.total_supply
}
```

> Runs in a WASM VM, deterministic and verifiable.

## Shared Advanced Topics

### Lifetimes, Generics, and Zero-Cost Abstractions

| Feature           | Use                                                 |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Lifetimes         | Ensure no dangling refs even in embedded & unsafe   |
| `PhantomData`     | Act like you own a type without storing it          |
| Traits + Generics | Create abstract, reusable, zero-overhead code       |
| `Pin`             | Prevent values from moving (for self-refs, futures) |

---

## Unsafe Code, FFI, and Low-Level Memory

### You Should Know How to:

* Use raw pointers `*const T`, `*mut T`
* Use `unsafe` blocks *correctly* (and wrap them in safe APIs)
* Expose or consume C APIs via `extern "C"` + `#[repr(C)]`
* Manage aligned memory and uninitialized memory
* Use `std::ptr::addr_of`, `std::mem::MaybeUninit`, etc.

### Example: Safe Wrapper Over Unsafe Code

```rust
fn write_reg(addr: usize, val: u32) {
    unsafe {
        (addr as *mut u32).write_volatile(val);
    }
}
```
