# Using Crates:

While learning rust programming is it advisable to jump into using crates 
or is the right approach to avoid them and try to reimplement the features 
that you desire to use in the program via crates. And then make another copy
to implement the same logic using crates.


When learning Rust, **thereâ€™s value in both approaches**: using crates *and* trying to reimplement some
functionality yourself. 

The best path depends on your goals at a given point in time. 


Here's a breakdown of how to balance the two:

---

### **When to Use Crates Early**

Crates are the Rust ecosystem's way of providing reusable, battle-tested libraries â€” similar to packages 
in Python (PyPI) or Node (npm).

**Advantages:**

* You learn idiomatic Rust from well-written, widely-used crates.
* You avoid reinventing the wheel (important for real-world productivity).
* You get experience with `Cargo.toml`, dependency management, and versioning.
* You see how to structure and use external code, a key part of Rust development.

**Recommended Crates to Get Comfortable With:**

* `serde` (serialization)
* `regex` (regular expressions)
* `reqwest` (HTTP requests)
* `tokio` or `async-std` (async runtimes)
* `clap` (CLI argument parsing)
* `anyhow` or `thiserror` (error handling)

These teach a lot about traits, macros, lifetimes, and async â€” major pillars of Rust.

---

### **When to Reimplement Features Yourself**

Rewriting functionality is incredibly valuable **as an exercise**, but not necessarily for production use.

**Why reimplement sometimes:**

* Deepens your understanding of how things *work* under the hood.
* Helps you internalize concepts like ownership, lifetimes, iterators, traits, etc.
* Makes you appreciate the complexity that crates abstract away.
* Gives you confidence that you *can* write those things if needed.

Examples of things worth reimplementing for learning:

* Writing your own iterator or filter/map-style functions
* Building a small parser instead of using `nom`
* Creating a tiny HTTP client with `std::net::TcpStream`
* Implementing basic command-line argument parsing before using `clap`

---

### A Balanced Approach (Best of Both Worlds)

Hereâ€™s a practical plan:

1. **Start With Reimplementation (When Learning the Concept)**
   Reimplement something simple to grasp the concept. 
   For example, write your own mini-`map()` function to understand closures and iterators.

2. **Then Use the Crate**
   Switch to the crate version for more complex needs, and to see how itâ€™s done professionally. 
   Learn from its documentation and design patterns.

3. **Compare Your Version With the Crate**
   What does the crate do that you didnâ€™t think of? What edge cases does it handle? 
   Any performance improvements?

4. **Keep Production Code Idiomatic**
   In real projects, use crates. Your future self (and others) will thank you.

---

### What to Avoid

* Avoid writing everything from scratch in a misguided attempt at "purity". 
  This slows down your learning and creates bad habits.

* Avoid relying on crates so much that you donâ€™t understand the code you're writing. 
  Always aim for comprehension, not just copying.

# List of Recommended Things to rewrite:


When you want to **master Rust** and truly understand what's happening under the hood, reimplementing 
certain features yourself is a fantastic exercise. 

Here's a **list of recommended things to rewrite**, organized by topic and increasing complexity.

---

### 6. **Channels (Messaging Between Threads)**

* Implement a basic version of `mpsc::channel`.

==>  *Teaches:* Threads, ownership, concurrency, synchronization.

---

##  **Utility Libraries / Tools**

### 9. **Your Own `Option` or `Result`**

* Reimplement `Option<T>` and `Result<T, E>` as an exercise.

---

## **Bonus: Rebuild Common Crates (Mini Versions)**

| Crate   | Reimplement                     | Why?                                        |
| ------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `clap`  | CLI parser                      | Arg parsing, enums, pattern matching        |
| `serde` | Simple serializer/deserializer  | Traits, generics, reflection limits         |
| `regex` | Mini regex engine (subset)      | Pattern parsing, finite automata (advanced) |
| `tokio` | Mini async executor             | Task scheduling, async internals            |
| `rayon` | Parallel iterators (very basic) | Threads, work-stealing                      |

---

##  Strategy to Follow

1. **Pick a problem**, like a config file parser.
2. **Implement it without crates**, as far as you can.
3. **Read the source code** of a popular crate that does the same.
4. **Refactor your solution** using the crate.
5. **Compare performance, ergonomics, and readability.**
