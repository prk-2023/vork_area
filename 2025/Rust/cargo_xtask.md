# Cargo xtask ( common convention )

"**catgo xtask**" : This is a common convention within the Rust community for managing and automating project specifically tasks that are not clearly defined by **cargo** itself.

Think of it as your projectâ€™s personal helper tool.

A Rust programmer already knows how to use commands like cargo build to compile code or cargo run to run the app. But sometimes, a project needs to do extra stuff â€” things like generating code, running CI checks, deploying, or cleaning up generated files â€” and cargo doesnâ€™t have built-in commands for these.

You could write shell scripts or Python scripts for this, but those often become messy, hard to maintain, and non-portable across platforms (e.g. Windows vs macOS vs Linux). This is where the xtask pattern comes in.

It's basically a special, small Rust program that lives inside your "main project". 
You can teach this "**xtask**" program to do all those extra jobs.

And once we have set it up we can tell cargo to run xtask helper. (Instead of messy complex commands like "python cleanup_script.py") you can run some thing clean and easy like :
    "cargo xtask clean"

Example: 

1. You create a mini-rust proj called "xtask" inside your main proj, ( some thing like building a control panel just for your project's chores )

2. Inside this "xtask" control panel, you write Rust code for each chore. So you'd have one function for "clean up" and another for "make docs"... etc

3. You then tell "cargo" to run your "xtask" helper: you'd type 
    ` cargo run -p xtask -- clean` which is the "clean" chores for example. 

  ( Often people setup a shortcut so they can just type "cargo xtask clean" which is even nice )

The above approach keeps everything in one place ( proj, custom actions are organized together) This make no more hunting for randoms scripts.

Since "xtask" is a rust program, you will get all the benifits of Rust for your chores. Its fast, safe, and works everywhere Rust works ( across OS's )

Easy for others: Someone joins a project, they do not have to guess how to run special tasks. You just tell them "Check **cargo xtask** !".

Cargo xtask is a way to make custom, project-specific commands that work just like regular cargo commands. It helps you automate tasks beyond building and running your code, keeping your project organized and easy to manage for everyone.



## So what is `xtask`?

Itâ€™s basically a small **Rust binary crate** (a little Rust program) that lives inside your main project. You teach this `xtask` program to perform all your extra chores or automation tasks.

Then you can run those tasks with commands like:

```bash
cargo xtask clean
```

Instead of messy shell scripts like:

```bash
bash scripts/dev_clean.sh
```
### Example: How it Works

1. **Create a new crate named `xtask` inside your project:**

   ```
   my_project/
   â”œâ”€â”€ .cargo/config.toml
   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
   â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
   â””â”€â”€ xtask/
       â”œâ”€â”€ src/
       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.rs
       â””â”€â”€ Cargo.toml
   ```

   Global alias mechanism to define persistent Cargo command aliases that work across any work space
   ```
   # .cargo/config.toml
   [alias]
   xtask = "run -p xtask --"
   ```
2. **Write Rust code inside `xtask/src/main.rs`** for your custom tasks:

   ```rust
   fn main() {
       let task = std::env::args().nth(1).expect("No task given");
       match task.as_str() {
           "clean" => {
               println!("Running custom clean task...");
               // Add your custom clean logic here
           }
           "doc" => {
               println!("Generating docs...");
               // Add doc generation logic
           }
           _ => {
               eprintln!("Unknown task: {}", task);
           }
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Run your custom task like this:**

   ```bash
   cargo run -p xtask -- clean
   ```

   Or, set up a shortcut alias in your root `Cargo.toml`:

   ```toml
   [alias]
   xtask = "run -p xtask --"
   ```

   Then you can just type:

   ```bash
   cargo xtask clean
   ```

### Benefits of Using `xtask`

* âœ… **Organized**: All your tasks are in one place (`xtask` crate).
* âœ… **Safe**: You write tasks in Rust, not in shell scripts â€” no "bash gotchas".
* âœ… **Cross-platform**: Runs anywhere Rust runs.
* âœ… **Discoverable**: New contributors just need to run `cargo xtask help` (if you add a help task) to see all available tasks.
* âœ… **Testable**: You can write tests for your automation code!


# Example:

1. mkdir xtask_proj; cd xtask_proj; mkdir .cargo; touch .cargo/config.toml
2. .cargo/config.toml 
    [alias]
    xtask = "run -p xtask --"

3. cargo new hello --vcs none ; cargo new xtask --vcs none 
4. 
$ cat xtask/src/main.rs 

fn main() {
    let task = std::env::args().nth(1).unwrap_or_else(|| {
        eprintln!("No task specified. Try: cargo xtask help");
        std::process::exit(1);
    });

    match task.as_str() {
        "hello" => task_hello(),
        "clean" => task_clean(),
        "help" => task_help(),
        _ => {
            eprintln!("Unknown task: {task}");
            task_help();
        }
    }
}

fn task_hello() {
    println!("ðŸ‘‹ Hello from xtask!");
}

fn task_clean() {
    println!("ðŸ§¹ Performing custom clean...");
    // Example: delete a folder
    let target_dir = "./target/";
    match std::fs::remove_dir_all(target_dir) {
        Ok(_) => println!("Removed {target_dir}"),
        Err(e) => println!("Could not remove {target_dir}: {e}"),
    }
}

fn task_help() {
    println!("Available xtasks:");
    println!("  cargo xtask hello   # Print a hello message");
    println!("  cargo xtask clean   # Clean custom temp files");
    println!("  cargo xtask help    # Show this help message");
}
