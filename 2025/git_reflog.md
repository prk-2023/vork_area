## 🔧 When `git reflog` can't find your lost commit...

If you’re trying to recover a lost commit (e.g., after a `reset`, `rebase`, or accidental deletion) and 
`git reflog` doesn't show it anymore — maybe because the reflog expired or was garbage collected 
— here’s what you can try:

---

### ✅ Step 1: Try `git reflog` first (if you haven’t already)

```bash
git reflog
```

This shows the recent history of where HEAD and other references pointed — it includes commits even 
after `reset`, `rebase`, or deleted branches (as long as they haven’t been garbage collected).

If you **see your commit hash** in this list, great — you can recover it with:

```bash
git checkout <commit-hash>
```

But if **nothing useful shows up**…

---

### 🛠️ Step 2: Use `git fsck --lost-found` to find dangling commits

```bash
git fsck --lost-found
```

This scans your Git object database and shows “dangling” (unreferenced) objects — including:

* **dangling commits** (lost commits not attached to any branch or tag)
* **dangling blobs** (file contents with no current reference)

You’ll see output like:

```
dangling commit a1b2c3d4e5f6...
dangling blob 7g8h9i0j...
```

### 👉 To inspect a dangling commit:

You can use `git show`:

```bash
git show a1b2c3d4e5f6
```

If it’s the commit you lost, you can either:

* Create a branch from it:

  ```bash
  git checkout -b recovered-branch a1b2c3d4e5f6
  ```
* Or cherry-pick it back into your current branch.

---

### 🔎 Optional: View all dangling commits easily

You can get just the list of dangling commits like this:

```bash
git fsck --no-reflogs | grep 'dangling commit'
```
