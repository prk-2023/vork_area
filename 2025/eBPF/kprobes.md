# Understanding kprobes and Breakpoint/Trap Instructions in Linux Kernel


**kprobes** and how breakpoints/trap instructions fit in:

---

### What are kprobes?

**kprobes** is a Linux kernel feature that allows you to dynamically insert debugging or tracing probes into almost any running kernel code without recompiling or rebooting.

These probes can intercept kernel function calls, collect information, or alter behavior — making them a powerful tool for debugging and performance analysis.

---

### How do kprobes work?

At a high level, **kprobes** operate by temporarily replacing an instruction in the kernel code with a special CPU instruction called a **breakpoint** or **trap** instruction.

---

### What is a breakpoint/trap instruction?

A **breakpoint (or trap) instruction** is a special CPU command designed to interrupt normal execution and transfer control to the kernel’s exception handler. It’s an intentional “stop signal” for the CPU, used mainly for debugging and tracing.

* On **x86**, the breakpoint instruction is `INT 3`, represented by the byte `0xCC`.
* On **ARM** and other architectures, similar trap instructions exist.

When the CPU encounters this instruction during execution, it raises a **trap exception**, causing the processor to switch from user/kernel mode into a special handler routine inside the kernel.

---

### The role of breakpoints in kprobes

Here’s the sequence of what happens when you set a kprobe:

1. **Instruction replacement:** The kernel replaces the original instruction at the target address with a breakpoint instruction (e.g., `INT 3`).

2. **Trap triggered:** When the kernel executes this breakpoint instruction, the CPU traps into the kernel’s exception handler.

3. **Probe handler invoked:** The kernel’s trap handler identifies that the trap was caused by a kprobe, saves the CPU context, and calls your registered probe callback function.

4. **Instruction emulation:** Since the original instruction was replaced by the breakpoint, the kernel emulates or executes the original instruction on your behalf, ensuring the program behaves correctly.

5. **Resume execution:** After the probe logic runs and the original instruction is emulated, normal execution resumes as if uninterrupted.

---

### Why is this important?

* **Dynamic instrumentation:** You can add probes on live kernels without recompiling or rebooting.
* **Safe debugging:** Breakpoints allow the kernel to pause execution safely and invoke custom logic.
* **Fine-grained control:** You can monitor specific instructions or function calls with minimal performance overhead.
* **Platform support:** Every CPU architecture has its own trap instruction, enabling kprobes to work broadly.

---

### Summary

* **kprobes** insert **breakpoint/trap instructions** into kernel code to intercept execution.
* When hit, these breakpoints generate traps handled by the kernel’s exception handler.
* The handler executes your probe code, then emulates the replaced instruction to continue normal flow.
* This mechanism provides flexible, safe, and efficient dynamic tracing and debugging in Linux.

# breakpoint/trap instruction:

### What is a breakpoint/trap instruction?

A **breakpoint** (or **trap**) instruction is a special CPU instruction that intentionally causes the processor to stop normal execution and transfer control to a **debugging or exception handler** in the kernel.

---

### Key points:

* **Purpose:** Used to interrupt program flow to let a debugger or kernel tracing facility inspect or modify execution.

* **Common Instructions:**

  * **x86:** `INT 3` (1 byte `0xCC`) — the classic breakpoint instruction.
  * **ARM:** `BRK` or similar instructions serve the same purpose.
  * Other architectures have their own equivalents.

* **How it works:**

  * When the CPU executes the breakpoint instruction, it generates a **trap exception** (interrupt).
  * The CPU switches from user/kernel code to an exception handler (part of the OS kernel).
  * The handler can then inspect the program state, run tracing code, or decide how to continue.

* **In kprobes:**

  * The original instruction at the probe location is replaced with a breakpoint instruction.
  * When hit, the kernel’s trap handler recognizes it’s from a kprobe, runs the probe’s callback, then emulates the original instruction.

---

### Why is it useful?

* It provides a **safe and efficient** way to interrupt code execution at precise points.
* Enables **dynamic tracing** without stopping or modifying the running system extensively.
* Supports **debugging and performance monitoring**.



 Here’s a high-level overview of how breakpoints (specifically **kprobes**) are implemented inside the Linux kernel:

---

### 1. **What is a kprobe breakpoint?**

A kprobe sets a **trap instruction** (breakpoint) at the start of a kernel instruction you want to trace — often the beginning of a function or any arbitrary instruction.

---

### 2. **How does the kernel insert a breakpoint?**

* The kernel replaces the instruction at the probe address with a special **breakpoint/trap instruction**:

  * On x86, this is usually the `INT 3` instruction (1 byte: `0xCC`).
  * On ARM, it might be a different kind of breakpoint instruction.

* The original instruction is saved in a buffer inside the kernel so it can be executed later.

---

### 3. **What happens when the breakpoint is hit?**

* When the CPU executes the breakpoint instruction, it triggers a **trap** (an exception).
* The kernel's breakpoint handler gets called.
* The handler recognizes that this trap corresponds to a kprobe.

---

### 4. **How does the kernel continue execution?**

* The kernel temporarily disables the breakpoint and emulates (or executes) the original replaced instruction.
* Then, the kernel calls your kprobe handler callback function (which could be your eBPF program).
* Finally, the kernel re-enables the breakpoint instruction at the probe address.
* Execution resumes normally from the instruction after the breakpoint.

---

### 5. **Handling concurrency and multiple CPUs**

* The kernel makes sure that breakpoints are installed and removed **atomically**, so other CPUs won’t execute a partially replaced instruction.
* Per-CPU variables and CPU hotplug events are handled carefully so kprobes stay consistent.

---

### 6. **Why not just use ptrace?**

* `ptrace` is a user-space debugging interface. It’s relatively slow and heavyweight.
* Kprobes are designed for **efficient, low-overhead tracing** inside the kernel itself, without user-space involvement.
* Kprobes allow you to attach probes dynamically, even on production systems, with minimal performance impact.

### Summary in a nutshell

| Step                   | Description                                                          |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Replace instruction    | Put a trap (breakpoint) instruction in place of original instruction |
| Trap triggered         | CPU hits trap, enters kernel breakpoint handler                      |
| Execute original instr | Kernel emulates or executes replaced original instruction            |
| Call handler           | Kernel calls kprobe handler (e.g., your eBPF program)                |
| Reinstall breakpoint   | Kernel restores trap instruction and resumes execution               |

# tracepoints and kprobes:

Exactly, you’ve got the right idea about **tracepoints**! They hook into predefined kernel instrumentation points with a stable ABI (the `format` file in `/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/...` shows exactly what data you get). Your eBPF program can then read those fields in a safe and structured way.

---

### How **kprobes** work in contrast?

* **Tracepoints**: Kernel-defined static instrumentation points with fixed, documented format.
* **Kprobes**: Dynamic instrumentation that hooks **any kernel function** (or user function in uprobes) at runtime, by inserting probes at the function’s **entry or return**.

---

### How does a kprobe work in Aya eBPF?

1. **You specify the kernel function name you want to probe.**

   For example, say you want to hook the kernel function `do_fork`.

2. **Aya attaches a kprobe to that function.**

   * The kernel inserts a breakpoint or trap at the function’s entry.
   * When the kernel hits that breakpoint during execution, your eBPF program runs.

3. **Your eBPF program gets a context (`KProbeContext`)**

   * From this context, you can read the CPU registers and stack frame.
   * You manually parse the function arguments by reading the appropriate registers or stack offsets.
   * No `format` file here, because kprobes don’t have fixed ABI formats like tracepoints.

---

### What about function arguments with kprobes?

Unlike tracepoints, **kprobes do not provide a standardized ABI description**, so:

* You need to know the **function’s signature and calling convention** for your target architecture.
* Then, use `ctx.arg(n)` (Aya provides helpers) or read registers directly to extract arguments.
* Example for x86\_64, the first arguments are usually in registers like `rdi`, `rsi`, `rdx`, etc.

---

### Example sketch of a kprobe eBPF program in Aya

```rust
use aya_bpf::{bindings::pt_regs, macros::kprobe, programs::KProbeContext};
use core::mem;

#[kprobe(name = "do_fork_entry")]
pub fn do_fork_entry(ctx: KProbeContext) -> u32 {
    match try_do_fork_entry(ctx) {
        Ok(ret) => ret,
        Err(_) => 1,
    }
}

fn try_do_fork_entry(ctx: KProbeContext) -> Result<u32, i64> {
    // For x86_64, first arg in rdi register
    let regs = ctx.regs();

    // Read first argument (e.g. clone_flags)
    let clone_flags: u64 = unsafe { ptr::read(regs as *const _ as *const u64) }; // simplified

    // Or use ctx.arg(n) in aya to get arguments safely if available

    // Log or process clone_flags
    bpf_printk!("do_fork clone_flags: {}\n", clone_flags);

    Ok(0)
}
```

### Summary

| Aspect               | Tracepoint                              | Kprobe                                     |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Hook location        | Static, well-defined kernel tracepoints | Any kernel function entry or exit          |
| ABI definition       | Stable, documented (`format` file)      | None, you must know the function ABI       |
| Function args access | Via `ctx.read_at` offsets               | Via register reading or `ctx.arg(n)`       |
| Stability            | Stable across kernel versions           | Less stable, can break with kernel changes |

---

### TL;DR

* **Tracepoints** are easier and safer to use because of the stable ABI.
* **Kprobes** are more powerful and flexible but require deeper knowledge about kernel internals (function signatures, calling conventions).
* Aya provides abstractions to help with both but your eBPF logic needs to manually interpret kprobe arguments.

If you want, I can also help you explore sample kprobe code or how this integrates with user-space tools like **perf** or **bpftrace**!
---

Let's extend the explanation with a **realistic example of using kprobes**, especially how they integrate with **eBPF** via frameworks like **Aya**, or tools like **bpftrace** and **perf**.

---

## 🔧 Practical Example: Using kprobes with eBPF

### 🧩 Goal

Trace when the `do_execveat_common` kernel function is called (which handles process execution), and print the current PID.

---

## ✅ Option 1: Using Aya (Rust + eBPF)

Here's a simplified structure of an **Aya-based kprobe** project.

### 1. **Define eBPF kprobe program**

**`src/kprobe_execve.rs` (in your `-ebpf` crate):**

```rust
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

use aya_bpf::{macros::kprobe, programs::KProbeContext};
use aya_log_ebpf::info;

#[kprobe(name="trace_execve")]
pub fn trace_execve(ctx: KProbeContext) -> u32 {
    match unsafe { try_trace_execve(ctx) } {
        Ok(ret) => ret,
        Err(_) => 1,
    }
}

unsafe fn try_trace_execve(ctx: KProbeContext) -> Result<u32, i64> {
    let pid = bpf_get_current_pid_tgid() >> 32;
    info!(&ctx, "do_execveat_common called by pid: {}", pid);
    Ok(0)
}
```

This attaches to the kernel function and logs the calling process's PID.

> The function name `do_execveat_common` is usually stable, but always verify via `/proc/kallsyms` or `grep do_execveat /boot/System.map-*`.

---

### 2. **Attach the kprobe from userspace**

**`main.rs` in user crate:**

```rust
use aya::programs::KProbe;
use aya::{include_bytes_aligned, Bpf};
use tokio::signal;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), anyhow::Error> {
    let mut bpf = Bpf::load(include_bytes_aligned!(
        concat!(env!("OUT_DIR"), "/your-ebpf-program")
    ))?;

    let program: &mut KProbe = bpf.program_mut("trace_execve")?.try_into()?;
    program.load()?;
    program.attach("do_execveat_common", 0)?;

    println!("Tracing execve... Press Ctrl+C to exit.");
    signal::ctrl_c().await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

---

## ✅ Option 2: Using bpftrace (easier, shell-based)

No coding needed. Just use the command line:

```bash
sudo bpftrace -e 'kprobe:do_execveat_common { printf("PID %d called execve\n", pid); }'
```

### Output:

```
PID 3421 called execve
PID 3422 called execve
...
```

This uses **kprobes under the hood** and attaches dynamically.

---

## ✅ Option 3: Using `perf`

The `perf` tool can also trace kernel functions using kprobes:

```bash
sudo perf probe -a do_execveat_common
sudo perf record -e probe:do_execveat_common -aR sleep 5
sudo perf script
```

---

## 🔍 Verifying Available kprobe Targets

You can check which kernel functions are traceable:

```bash
cat /proc/kallsyms | grep execve
```

---

## 🧠 Bonus: Uprobes (User-space equivalents)

If you want to trace user-space functions (e.g., glibc's `malloc`), you'd use **uprobes** instead of kprobes. Same idea — dynamic instrumentation — just applied to user-space binaries instead of the kernel.

---

## 🎓 Summary

| Tool       | Language | Setup Required | Use Case                     |
| ---------- | -------- | -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Aya (Rust) | Rust     | Medium-High    | Full control, production use |
| bpftrace   | Shell    | Very Low       | Quick tracing                |
| perf       | Shell    | Low            | Performance/event tracing    |

Here's a **complete end-to-end guide** to create a **kprobe tracing project using Aya**, which will:

> Attach a kprobe to the kernel function `do_execveat_common` and log the PID of the calling process.

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step: Aya kprobe Project

### ✅ 0. **Prerequisites**

Make sure you have:

* Rust (with `rustup`)
* `rust-src` component:

  ```bash
  rustup component add rust-src
  ```
* LLVM + Clang (for BPF target, e.g., `clang-16` or higher)
* A kernel with BTF enabled (most modern distros have this)
* [`bpftool`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/bpftool.8.html) and `libbpf-dev` are helpful for debugging

---

### ✅ 1. **Project Layout**

We'll use a 3-crate workspace:

```
aya-kprobe-example/
├── Cargo.toml
├── kprobe-ebpf/           # eBPF bytecode (no_std)
├── kprobe-common/         # Shared code if needed
└── kprobe-user/           # User-space loader
```

---

### ✅ 2. **Workspace `Cargo.toml`**

```toml
[workspace]
members = ["kprobe-user", "kprobe-ebpf", "kprobe-common"]

[workspace.dependencies]
aya = { version = "0.13", default-features = false }
aya-log = { version = "0.2" }
aya-log-ebpf = { version = "0.1" }
aya-build = "0.1"
```

---

### ✅ 3. **eBPF crate: `kprobe-ebpf`**

```bash
cargo new --lib kprobe-ebpf
```

Edit `kprobe-ebpf/Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package]
name = "kprobe-ebpf"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
build = "build.rs"

[dependencies]
aya-bpf = { version = "0.13", default-features = false }
aya-log-ebpf = "0.1"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[build-dependencies]
aya-build = "0.1"
```

Create `build.rs`:

```rust
fn main() {
    aya_build::BpfBuilder::new()
        .source("src/main.rs")
        .build()
        .unwrap();
}
```

Now `src/main.rs`:

```rust
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

use aya_bpf::{
    macros::kprobe,
    programs::KProbeContext,
    helpers::bpf_get_current_pid_tgid,
};
use aya_log_ebpf::info;

#[kprobe(name = "trace_execve")]
pub fn trace_execve(ctx: KProbeContext) -> u32 {
    match unsafe { try_trace_execve(&ctx) } {
        Ok(_) => 0,
        Err(_) => 1,
    }
}

unsafe fn try_trace_execve(ctx: &KProbeContext) -> Result<(), i64> {
    let pid = bpf_get_current_pid_tgid() >> 32;
    info!(ctx, "execve called by pid: {}", pid);
    Ok(())
}
```

---

### ✅ 4. **User-space loader: `kprobe-user`**

```bash
cargo new --bin kprobe-user
```

Edit `kprobe-user/Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package]
name = "kprobe-user"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
aya = "0.13"
aya-log = "0.2"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
anyhow = "1.0"
```

Now `src/main.rs`:

```rust
use aya::{include_bytes_aligned, Bpf};
use aya::programs::KProbe;
use aya_log::BpfLogger;
use anyhow::Context;
use tokio::signal;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let mut bpf = Bpf::load(include_bytes_aligned!(
        concat!(env!("OUT_DIR"), "/kprobe-ebpf")
    ))?;

    if let Err(e) = BpfLogger::init(&mut bpf) {
        eprintln!("failed to initialize logger: {e}");
    }

    let program: &mut KProbe = bpf.program_mut("trace_execve")
        .context("Failed to get program")?
        .try_into()
        .context("Failed to cast to KProbe")?;

    program.load()?;
    program.attach("do_execveat_common", 0)?;

    println!("Tracing execve... Press Ctrl+C to stop.");
    signal::ctrl_c().await?;
    println!("Exiting.");

    Ok(())
}
```

---

### ✅ 5. **Build the whole project**

Create a `kprobe-user/build.rs` to compile the eBPF program:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("cargo:rerun-if-changed=../kprobe-ebpf/src/main.rs");
}
```

Then in your `kprobe-user/Cargo.toml`, add:

```toml
[build-dependencies]
aya-build = "0.1"
```

---

### ✅ 6. **Build & Run**

```bash
cargo build --release
sudo ./target/release/kprobe-user
```

In another terminal:

```bash
ls
echo "something" > /dev/null
```

You should see logs like:

```
execve called by pid: 2345
execve called by pid: 2346
```

> These show every time a process executes a new binary using `execve`.

---

### ✅ 7. **Debugging Tips**

* Check `dmesg` if the program fails silently.
* Use `bpftool prog` and `bpftool map` to inspect loaded BPF programs.
* Use `/proc/kallsyms | grep do_execve` to find function names.

---

## 🎯 Summary

You now have a working Aya-based **kprobe** tracing tool in Rust that:

* Attaches dynamically to a kernel function
* Extracts and logs process info
* Uses modern eBPF (no kernel rebuilds, no modules)

---

Would you like this wrapped into a GitHub-ready project template? Or extended to trace `fork`, `open`, or `write` syscalls too?
