# AYA: 
---

If you’re familiar with the **block-level design of eBPF** (maps, programs, hooks, verifier, JIT), you're 
already ahead of many folks who start with `bpftrace` or `bcc`.

Let’s look at how you can **learn Aya**, a Rust-based eBPF framework, *without* needing deep experience 
with `bpftrace` or `bcc`.

---

## Quick Summary

* **Aya** is a *from-scratch* Rust-native library for writing and loading eBPF programs.
* **bpftrace** and **bcc** are high-level tools that abstract away much of the low-level details.
* You can **skip bpftrace/bcc** if you prefer to work close to the kernel, and with **type safety and modern 
  tooling** (which Rust provides).

---

## Good News for You

You already know how eBPF works at a block level — programs, maps, loaders, hooks (tracepoints, kprobes, 
etc.). That’s the **mental model** bpftrace/bcc try to hide under the hood.

So you **don’t need to master bpftrace or bcc** to be successful with Aya. You just need to understand how 
they map to the same building blocks you already know:

| Concept             | eBPF Block                       | `bpftrace` / `bcc` | Aya                                           |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Hook point          | kprobe/tracepoint etc.           | Automatic          | You declare and attach manually               |
| eBPF Program        | BPF bytecode                     | Hidden             | Written in Rust + compiled with `cargo xtask` |
| Maps                | Shared memory                    | Hidden             | Defined in Rust (with full control)           |
| Userspace loader    | `bpftrace` CLI or Python scripts | Hidden             | Rust app using `aya::Bpf`                     |
| Event communication | perf ring buffer / maps          | Abstracted         | Manual but fully customizable                 |
| Verifier            | Kernel                           | Transparent        | Errors shown in Rust build or at load time    |

---

## Your Learning Path

Here’s a **focused path** for learning Aya without needing to first master `bpftrace` or `bcc`.

---

### Step 1: Firm Up the eBPF Blocks (You already know)

Make sure you’re confident in:

* What are eBPF programs (and types like `tracepoint`, `kprobe`, `xdp`, etc.)
* What are eBPF maps (array, hash, ring buffer, perf buffer, etc.)
* How kernel and user space interact via maps or ring buffers

If you’re fuzzy on verifier logic or helpers, I can provide cheat sheets.

---

### Step 2: Setup Aya and Build a Simple App

Follow the official Aya book:
[https://aya-rs.dev/book/](https://aya-rs.dev/book/)

Try their **minimal tracepoint example**:

* eBPF program in `src/bpf/`
* Loader in `src/main.rs`
* Build using `cargo xtask build-ebpf`

It’s structured cleanly and shows you:

* How to attach to `tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_execve`
* How to use a perf buffer to send events to userspace
* How to read them in real time

---

### Step 3: Learn via Comparisons (Optional but helpful)

If you ever get stuck, it's useful to **compare Aya to bpftrace**:

| Goal            | Aya                                   | bpftrace                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Trace syscalls  | Tracepoint hook + program             | `tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_*` |
| Print arguments | Serialize event struct to perf buffer | `printf()`                        |
| Filter by PID   | Add check in BPF program              | `/pid == 1234/`                   |
| Track counts    | Use `HashMap` or `PerfEventArray`     | `@counts[pid] = count()`          |

So if you understand a bpftrace one-liner like:

```bash
bpftrace -e 'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_execve { printf("PID: %d\n", pid); }'
```

You can think of the Aya equivalent as:

* Attach a Rust-based BPF program to the same tracepoint
* In the program, format data into a struct
* Send via perf buffer
* Read and print in userspace Rust

---

### Step 4: Experiment and Build

Ideas you can try building in Aya:

* Count how many times each syscall is called per PID
* Measure latency between syscall entry/exit
* Track failed `open()` calls
* Implement a per-process syscall histogram
* Parse `bpf_attr` when someone calls `bpf(BPF_PROG_LOAD)`

---

### Bonus: Real-World Project References

* Aya's example repo: [https://github.com/aya-rs/aya-template](https://github.com/aya-rs/aya-template)
* RedBPF (older, not recommended now)
* Facebook’s Katran (written in C but shows real-world eBPF infra)

---

##  Summary

You **don’t need** to fully master `bpftrace` or `bcc` to learn **Aya**:

- You already have the mental model of eBPF
- Aya gives you full control in Rust (with safety)
- You’ll learn more by directly writing and testing small Aya programs

Let me know if you want:

* A custom "hello world" Aya tracepoint example
* A walkthrough of how a perf buffer works in Aya
* A cheat sheet comparing Aya to bpftrace

# Aya

### **Aya: A Rust-Based Approach to eBPF Tracing (vs. BCC/BPFtrace/libbpf)**

Aya is an emerging **Rust-based eBPF library** that provides a **memory-safe**, low-overhead way to write 
and manage eBPF programs. 

It’s designed as an alternative to **BCC** (Python/Lua-based) and **libbpf** (C-based), with a focus on 
**performance, safety, and modern tooling**.

---

## **  Key Advantages of Aya**

### **1. Memory Safety (Rust’s Strong Suit)**
   - No undefined behavior, dangling pointers, or memory leaks (unlike C/libbpf).
   - Safer to write kernel-side BPF code due to Rust’s borrow checker.
   - Reduces risk of crashes in production.

### **2. No Runtime Compilation (Unlike BCC)**
   - Like `libbpf`, Aya **pre-compiles** BPF bytecode, avoiding the overhead of runtime LLVM/Clang 
     (which BCC uses).
   - Faster startup time and lower CPU/memory footprint.

### **3. Modern Tooling & Developer Experience**
   - Built-in support for **async** (Tokio) in userspace components.
   - Better IDE integration (thanks to Rust’s tooling).
   - Easier dependency management (`Cargo` vs. BCC’s Python/Lua scripts).

### **4. Works with Stable Rust**
   - Unlike some other Rust BPF projects, Aya doesn’t require nightly Rust.
   - More suitable for production deployments.

### **5. Good for Custom BPF Programs**
   - If you need **tailored BPF logic** (not just tracing), Aya is a great fit.
   - Example use cases:
     - Network filtering (XDP, TC)
     - Security enforcement (LSM probes)
     - Custom performance metrics

---

## **  How Aya Compares to Other Tools**
| Feature               | **Aya (Rust)** | **BCC (Python/C++)** | **BPFtrace** | **libbpf (C)** |
|----------------------|---------------|----------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Memory Safety**    | OK Yes (Rust)  | NO No (C/Python)      | NO No        | NO No (C)      |
| **Runtime Compilation** | NO No (pre-compiled) | OK Yes (LLVM) | NO No (scripting) | NO No (pre-compiled) |
| **Performance Overhead** | ⚡ Low | 🐢 Medium (due to runtime LLVM) | ⚡ Low (scripting) | ⚡ Low |
| **Ease of Use**      | 🟢 Good (Rust) | 🟡 Medium (Python/C++) | OK Very Easy | 🔴 Hard (C) |
| **Best For**         | Custom BPF programs, networking, security | Quick prototyping, tracing | Ad-hoc tracing | Production BPF programs (C) |

---

## **  When Should You Use Aya?**
OK **Use Aya if:**
   - You want **memory-safe BPF programs** (critical for security tools).
   - You need **low-overhead, pre-compiled BPF** (like `libbpf` but in Rust).
   - You prefer **Rust’s tooling** over Python/C.
   - You’re building **long-running BPF programs** (e.g., networking, security monitoring).

NO **Avoid Aya if:**
   - You just need **quick ad-hoc tracing** (use `bpftrace` instead).
   - You rely on **BCC’s Python/Lua bindings** for rapid prototyping.
   - You’re not familiar with Rust (learning curve vs. `bpftrace`).

---

## **  Example: Aya vs. BCC vs. BPFtrace**
### **1. Aya (Rust) - Custom BPF Program**

```rust
use aya::Bpf;
use aya::programs::KProbe;

let mut bpf = Bpf::load_file("my_program.o")?;
let probe: &mut KProbe = bpf.program_mut("my_kprobe")?.try_into()?;
probe.load()?;
probe.attach("do_sys_open", 0)?;
```
- **Pros:** Memory-safe, pre-compiled, efficient.
- **Cons:** Requires Rust knowledge.

### **2. BCC (Python) - Dynamic Tracing**
```python
from bcc import BPF
bpf = BPF(text='int kprobe__do_sys_open() { bpf_trace_printk("file opened!"); return 0; }')
bpf.trace_print()
```
- **Pros:** Quick to write, no compilation step.
- **Cons:** Higher overhead (runtime LLVM), unsafe.

### **3. BPFtrace (Scripting)**
```bash
bpftrace -e 'kprobe:do_sys_open { printf("file opened!\n"); }'
```
- **Pros:** Simplest for ad-hoc tracing.
- **Cons:** Limited to scripting, not for complex logic.

---

## **  Verdict: Is Aya Worth It?**
- **👍 Best for:** Production-grade BPF programs where **safety & performance** matter.
- **👎 Not ideal for:** One-off debugging (use `bpftrace`/`perf` instead).

If you're already using Rust, Aya is a **fantastic choice**. 
If you need quick debugging, stick with `bpftrace` or `BCC`. 
For C-based BPF, `libbpf` is still a solid option.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Aya for Embedded Systems: 
---

### **Aya vs. BCC vs. BPFtrace vs. libbpf on ARM/aarch64 Embedded Systems**

When working with **ARM-based embedded systems** (e.g., Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson, or custom IoT devices), 
resource constraints (CPU, memory, storage) and lack of Python/Lua infrastructure make some BPF tools less 
suitable. 

Here’s how **Aya (Rust)** compares to alternatives in this environment.

---

## **  Key Constraints in ARM Embedded Systems**
1. **Limited CPU/Memory**  
   - No room for runtime compilation (BCC’s LLVM is heavyweight).  
   - Minimal kernel overhead is crucial.  

2. **No Python/Lua Runtime**  
   - BCC’s Python/Lua scripting is unavailable.  
   - Need **statically compiled** binaries.  

3. **Limited Kernel Features**  
   - Some BPF features may be restricted (e.g., no JIT, limited helper functions).  
   - Kernel headers may be missing (affects BCC/libbpf).  

4. **Cross-Compilation Required**  
   - Need to build BPF programs on a host machine.  

---

## **  Comparison for ARM Embedded Systems**
| Feature               | **Aya (Rust)** | **BCC** | **BPFtrace** | **libbpf (C)** |
|----------------------|---------------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **ARM/aarch64 Support** | OK Yes | OK Yes (but heavy) | OK Yes (if built) | OK Yes |
| **No Python Required** | OK Yes | NO No (needs Python) | OK Yes | OK Yes |
| **Runtime Overhead** | ⚡ Very Low | 🐢 High (LLVM) | ⚡ Low | ⚡ Low |
| **Memory Safety** | OK Yes (Rust) | NO No | NO No | NO No |
| **Pre-Compiled BPF** | OK Yes | NO No (runtime LLVM) | NO No (script) | OK Yes |
| **Cross-Compilation** | OK Easy (Rust toolchain) | NO Hard (LLVM deps) | NO Needs bpftrace build | OK Possible |
| **Kernel Headers Needed?** | NO No (BTF helps) | OK Yes | OK Yes | OK Yes |
| **Best For** | Custom BPF programs (XDP, security) | NO Avoid (too heavy) | Ad-hoc debugging (if compiled) | Legacy C BPF |

---

## **  Best Choices for ARM Embedded**
### **1. OK Aya (Best for Custom BPF Programs)**
   - **Pros:**  
     - No Python, no runtime LLVM.  
     - Memory-safe Rust, minimal overhead.  
     - Works with **BTF (BPF Type Format)** → no kernel headers needed.  
   - **Cons:**  
     - Requires Rust toolchain (but can cross-compile easily).  
   - **Use Case:**  
     - Writing **custom BPF probes** for networking (XDP), security, or performance monitoring.  

### **2. OK libbpf (Best for Legacy C BPF)**
   - **Pros:**  
     - Lightweight, pre-compiled BPF.  
     - Works on older kernels (if BTF is unavailable).  
   - **Cons:**  
     - C code is unsafe (risk of crashes).  
     - Harder to maintain than Rust.  
   - **Use Case:**  
     - If you must use C (e.g., existing BPF codebase).  

### **3. BPFtrace (Only If Pre-Built)**
   - **Pros:**  
     - Great for ad-hoc debugging.  
   - **Cons:**  
     - Must be **cross-compiled** for ARM (no package manager support).  
     - Scripting model is less flexible than Aya/libbpf.  
   - **Use Case:**  
     - Quick debugging, if you can build it for your device.  

### **4. NO BCC (Avoid on Embedded)**
   - **Why?**  
     - Requires Python + LLVM (too heavy).  
     - Runtime compilation is slow and resource-intensive.  

---

## **  Example Workflow with Aya on ARM**
### **1. Cross-Compile BPF Program (on x86 Host)**
```sh
# Install Rust ARM toolchain
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu

# Build Aya BPF program for ARM
cargo build --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu --release
```

### **2. Deploy to ARM Device**
- Copy the compiled binary (`my_ebpf_program`) to the device.  
- Load it using `aya`’s userspace loader.  

### **3. Run BPF Program**
```rust
use aya::Bpf;
let mut bpf = Bpf::load_file("my_program.o")?; // Pre-compiled BPF
let probe: &mut KProbe = bpf.program_mut("my_kprobe")?.try_into()?;
probe.attach("do_sys_open", 0)?;
```

---

## **  Verdict: What Should You Use?**
| Scenario | Best Tool |
|----------|----------|
| **Custom BPF (XDP, security, etc.)** | OK **Aya** (Rust) |
| **Existing C BPF code** | OK **libbpf** |
| **Quick debugging** | ⚠️ **BPFtrace** (if pre-built) |
| **Avoid at all costs** | NO **BCC** |

### **Why Aya Wins for ARM Embedded?**
✔ **No Python/LLVM** → Minimal footprint.  
✔ **Memory-safe** → Fewer crashes in production.  
✔ **BTF support** → No kernel headers needed.  
✔ **Cross-compiles easily** → Works on ARM.  

If you're starting a new BPF project on ARM, **Aya is the best choice**. 
For existing C BPF code, **libbpf** is still viable. 

Avoid BCC and BPFtrace unless absolutely necessary.

# Introduction to Aya:


**Overview of `aya` and how it fits into the eBPF ecosystem**, particularly for **tracing, monitoring, and 
embedded use cases**.

---

## What Is Aya?

### Aya is a **pure Rust framework** for writing and loading eBPF programs.

Aya is a pure Rust framework for eBPF development, enabling you to write, compile, load, and manage eBPF
programs without relying on C-based tooling like libbpf or BCC.

It provides:

* A **no\_std Rust library** (`aya-bpf`) for writing kernel-space eBPF programs.

* **aya-bpf**: USed to write the acutal eBPF programs that run in the kernel( compiled to eBPF bytecode)

* A **userspace Rust library** (`aya`) for loading and interacting with those programs.

* **aya**: user-space lib that loads, attaches, and communicates with those eBPF programs from rust
  applications.

* Tools to **build, attach, and manage** BPF programs (like `aya-cli`)

Aya was designed for operability, portability, and developer ergonomics, making it a compelling choice for
cloud-native, systems, and embedded development.

---

## The Aya Stack: Two Parts

| Layer           | Crate     | Description                                |
| --------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Kernel-side** | `aya-bpf` | Rust code compiled into eBPF bytecode      |
| **User-space**  | `aya`     | Loader binary that manages the BPF program |

---

## How Aya Fits into eBPF Tracing

### eBPF Tracing: What Is It?

eBPF tracing is the act of dynamically attaching programs to kernel or userspace events to observe behavior:

* Track syscalls (e.g., `open`, `exec`, `write`)
* Trace function calls inside the kernel
* Monitor file/network activity, etc.

> **Traditionally**, tools like `BCC` or `BPFTrace` were used—usually with C or C-like scripts.
> **Aya** replaces that with safe, statically-typed **Rust**.

## What You Can Do With Aya

| Use Case                                   | Aya Support |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| KProbes / KRetProbes                       | OK Yes       |
| UProbes / URetProbes                       | OK Yes       |
| Tracepoints                                | OK Yes       |
| Perf events / PMCs                         | OK Yes       |
| XDP (network filtering)                    | OK Yes       |
| Socket filtering (SOCK\_MAP, SK\_MSG, etc) | OK Yes       |
| BPF Maps (hash, array, etc)                | OK Yes       |
| BTF-enabled introspection                  | OK Yes       |

So, Aya covers almost everything BCC/BPFTrace can, **with more control** and **Rust safety**.

---

## When to Use Aya (vs. BCC/BPFTrace)

| Scenario                          | Best Tool |
| --------------------------------- | --------- |
| Interactive prototyping           | BPFTrace  |
| Simple, one-liner syscall tracing | BPFTrace  |
| Kernel debug tracing in prod      | Aya OK     |
| No Python/Clang in system         | Aya OK     |
| Embedded / Minimal Linux          | Aya OKOKOK   |
| Need safe, typed Rust environment | Aya OK     |

---

## OK Why Choose Aya?

| Feature                   | Aya Benefits                        |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Rust Safety**           | No buffer overflows, safer logic    |
| **Cross-compile**         | Good for embedded systems           |
| **No Clang dependency**   | Smaller, leaner build setup         |
| **Low runtime footprint** | Just a binary + eBPF `.o` file      |
| **BTF Support**           | Can avoid installing kernel headers |
| **Full control**          | You manage the full loader + logic  |


## Why Aya works well for embedded:

| Feature                          | Benefit for Embedded Linux                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OK **Pure Rust Implementation**   | No C toolchain (e.g., LLVM, Clang, libbpf) needed—easier cross-compilation. |
| 📦 **Static Linking (via musl)** | Enables building small, self-contained binaries.                            |
| 📄 **BTF Support**               | Enhances portability across kernel versions without needing headers.        |
| 🧠 **Low Runtime Overhead**      | eBPF programs are executed in the kernel with very low overhead.            |
| 🐧 **Linux Kernel Support**      | eBPF is part of the Linux kernel since 4.x—common in embedded distros.      |
| 💬 **Data Sharing via Maps**     | eBPF maps allow lightweight communication between kernel and user space.    |

## Embedded Use Cases for Aya

### 1. **Device Monitoring / Telemetry**

* Collect low-level metrics (CPU usage, IO stats, network packets) directly from the kernel.
* Offload telemetry to the kernel to avoid user-space polling.

### 2. **Network Packet Filtering / QoS**

* Use eBPF for fine-grained traffic shaping, packet filtering, or custom protocol logic.
* Leverage XDP and TC (Traffic Control) programs for ultra-low latency networking.

### 3. **Security and Policy Enforcement**

* Trace system calls, monitor file access or process behavior without kernel modules.
* Enforce allowlists or blocklists on processes and syscalls.

### 4. **Minimal Footprint System Introspection**

* Use kprobes or uprobes to monitor system behavior with minimal binary size.

---

## 🛠️ Development Flow in Embedded

A typical Aya-based embedded workflow might look like:

1. **Write eBPF Program in `aya-bpf`**

   * Example: Trace file accesses with `kprobes`.
2. **Cross-compile with musl**

   * Compile both kernel-space and user-space components for your embedded architecture (e.g., `armv7`, `aarch64`).
3. **Deploy to Device**

   * Send the single binary to the embedded target.
4. **Run User-Space Aya Loader**

   * Load eBPF program into kernel and collect telemetry or enforce policies.

---

## Security Advantage

Aya (and eBPF in general) has a **security edge** in embedded:

* No need for kernel modules (which require elevated privileges and risk kernel crashes).
* eBPF is **verified** by the kernel’s in-kernel verifier before it’s allowed to run.

---

## Lightweight Comparison

| Feature                      | Aya                     | libbpf/BCC                 |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Language                     | Rust                    | C / Python                 |
| Userspace dependencies       | Only libc               | Requires LLVM, Clang, etc. |
| Embedded suitability         | OK Excellent             | 🚫 Heavy                   |
| Compile-once, run-everywhere | OK Yes (with BTF + musl) | NO Not easily               |

---

## Final Take

Aya brings the power of eBPF to the **embedded Linux world** by offering:

* **Minimal runtime footprint**
* **No external C toolchains**
* **High portability**
* **Rust safety and ergonomics**

Whether you're building telemetry agents, secure runtime monitors, or custom networking features in 
embedded systems, Aya is **an ideal fit for modern, Rust-first embedded Linux development**.


## The Aya Workflow (Visual) ( general case not limited to embedded )

```bash
1. Write eBPF program (aya-bpf) in Rust
    ↓
2. Compile to `.o` (eBPF bytecode)
    ↓
3. Write loader in Rust (aya crate)
    ↓
4. Loader loads .o into kernel, attaches to events
    ↓
5. Observe system behavior (logs, maps, metrics)
```

---

### Example Use Cases with Aya

* Trace all calls to `execve` and log command names
* Monitor all file opens on the system
* Watch TCP connections and log IPs
* Build a lightweight observability agent for production

---

##  Summary

* **Aya is a Rust-native, low-footprint alternative to BCC/BPFTrace**
* It's especially suited for **embedded systems**, **production monitoring**, and **safe tracing**
* You can trace anything from syscalls to kernel functions to network packets, 
  **all in safe, statically-checked Rust**

---

Next, we can go into:

* Aya project setup
* Writing a minimal kernel probe
* Using BTF to avoid kernel headers
* Building for embedded targets

Just let me know what you want to do next: 👇
Would you like to:

1. See a real example of a minimal `aya` project?
2. Learn how to generate Rust bindings from BTF (without kernel headers)?
3. Set up cross-compilation for ARM or RISC-V?

---

# Recommended work flow to learn aya 

Starting with x86_64 platform to learn and move over to aarch64:

---

## OK Why Start on x86\_64?

### 1. **Faster Development Loop**

* Easier to install tools (`cargo`, `llvm`, `aya-cli`, etc.)
* You can build, test, and debug quickly without worrying about cross-compilation or deploying to another 
  device.

### 2. **Same Kernel ABI / BTF Model**

* eBPF programs don’t rely on architecture-specific instructions rather they rely on 
  **kernel ABIs and event hooks**, which are consistent across architectures.

* You can **simulate the exact same probe logic** on `x86_64` that you’ll use on ARM later.

### 3. **Great Learning Environment**

* Easier to install `bpftool`, debug logs, use `dmesg`, and explore `/sys/kernel/debug/tracing`
* BTF support is usually already present in distros like Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.

---

## Then Move to aarch64 (Raspberry Pi, Rockchip)

Once you’re comfortable:

### 🏗️ Cross-compile the Aya-based project:

* Use `--target=aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` or `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`
* You only need to copy:

  * The compiled `.o` eBPF program
  * The compiled `aya` loader binary

### Run on your target:

* Raspberry Pi OS / Armbian / Yocto kernel must support:

  * `CONFIG_BPF`, `CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL`, `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF`
* Load and run the same tracing logic.

# How Aya works?

The **Linux kernel eBPF framework** supports **tracepoints, uprobes, kprobes, and maps**, and **Aya** 
provides a pure-Rust interface to work with all of them. 

Below is an overview of what these are and **how Aya uses them**:

| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Kprobes**     | Hook into kernel function entry points (used for dynamic tracing).         |
| **Kretprobes**  | Hook into kernel function exit points.                                     |
| **Tracepoints** | Static instrumentation points in the kernel, stable across versions.       |
| **Uprobes**     | Hook into user-space application functions (like libc or your own binary). |
| **Maps**        | Shared key-value stores between eBPF programs and user space.              |

---

## How Aya Uses These

Aya is a **pure Rust eBPF framework** that allows you to:

### 1. **Write eBPF Programs in Rust**

Aya uses [`aya-bpf`](https://docs.rs/aya-bpf/) crate for writing eBPF programs that will run in the kernel. 
These are no\_std programs (no heap or panics) and are compiled to eBPF bytecode using Rust + `cargo xtask` 
or a custom build script.

You can write different kinds of eBPF programs like:

* `kprobe`: Attach to kernel functions.
* `tracepoint`: Attach to pre-defined kernel tracepoints.
* `uprobe`: Attach to user-space functions.
* `maps`: Define `HashMap`, `PerfEventArray`, etc., to communicate with user space.

### 2. **Load and Attach eBPF Programs from User Space**

Aya uses the [`aya`](https://docs.rs/aya/) crate in user space to:

* Load the compiled eBPF bytecode.
* Attach it to the appropriate probe (e.g., a kprobe for `sys_execve`).
* Set up and manage eBPF maps (for sharing data between kernel and user space).
* Handle perf events, ring buffers, or async data streams.

### 3. **Example Use Case**

Let's say you want to trace the `execve` syscall using a **kprobe**:

#### Kernel Program (Rust, using `aya-bpf`):

```rust
#[kprobe(name = "execve_kprobe")]
pub fn execve_kprobe(ctx: ProbeContext) -> u32 {
    let comm = b"execve detected!\0";
    unsafe {
        bpf_trace_printk(comm.as_ptr(), comm.len());
    }
    0
}
```

#### User-space Loader (Rust, using `aya`):

```rust
let mut bpf = Bpf::load_file("target/bpf/programs/execve_kprobe/execve_kprobe.o")?;
let program: &mut KProbe = bpf.program_mut("execve_kprobe").unwrap().try_into()?;
program.load()?;
program.attach("do_execve", 0)?;
```

This code:

* Loads the `execve_kprobe` program.
* Attaches it to the `do_execve` kernel function.
* Runs the probe when that function is called.

### 4. **Maps and Communication**

Aya supports many eBPF map types:

* `HashMap`: For storing key-value data.
* `PerfEventArray` / `RingBuffer`: For sending data/events to user space.
* `Array`, `PerCpuArray`, `LruHashMap`, etc.

You can define a `PerfEventArray` in the kernel program and read from it asynchronously in the user-space 
loader.

## Summary Table: Aya Support for Kernel Primitives

| Feature         | Supported in Kernel | Supported in Aya? | Notes                         |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Kprobes**     | OK Yes               | OK Yes             | For tracing kernel functions  |
| **Kretprobes**  | OK Yes               | OK Yes             | Trace function returns        |
| **Tracepoints** | OK Yes               | OK Yes             | Stable tracing across kernels |
| **Uprobes**     | OK Yes               | OK Yes             | Trace user-space apps         |
| **Maps**        | OK Yes               | OK Yes             | For sharing data              |

## OK Bottom Line

Aya leverages the **core eBPF features provided by the Linux kernel**, but does so in **pure, safe Rust** 
without depending on C libraries like `libbpf` or BCC. 
You write probes in `aya-bpf`, load and control them with `aya`, and communicate between kernel and user 
space using eBPF maps—all using idiomatic Rust.

# Reference Notes:

## BTF Support

**BTF support** refers to the ability of a system or tool to understand and make use of 
**BPF Type Format (BTF)**, a metadata format used in the eBPF ecosystem on Linux.

### What is BTF?

**BTF (BPF Type Format)** is a compact binary format that describes **C types and debug information** for 
use by eBPF programs. 

It serves a similar purpose as DWARF (used in traditional debugging), but is optimized for the eBPF use case.

### Why BTF Matters for eBPF and Aya:

1. **Portability Across Kernel Versions**:

   * Kernel structures (e.g., `task_struct`, `sock`, etc.) can vary across kernel versions.
   * With **BTF**, eBPF programs can inspect type information directly from the running kernel, making it 
     easier to write portable eBPF code that dynamically adapts to different kernel versions.

2. **Compile Once, Run Everywhere**:

   * Instead of compiling a separate eBPF program for every kernel version, you can compile it once and use 
     **BTF data from the target system** to resolve symbols and types at runtime.
   * This is what Aya leverages when it's compiled with musl: a single binary can run on many distributions
     and kernel versions because it dynamically adapts to the kernel's layout using BTF.

3. **No Need for Kernel Headers**:

   * Traditional eBPF development often required kernel headers to understand internal kernel structures.
     With BTF, this dependency is eliminated.

4. **Smaller and More Efficient**:

   * BTF is smaller than DWARF and more suitable for embedding in the kernel or sharing between user and
     kernel space.

---

### In Summary

**BTF support** in Aya means that it can:

* Read type information directly from the kernel.
* Generate or load eBPF programs that adapt to the running system’s kernel structures.
* Avoid dependencies on external tools like `libbpf` or kernel headers.

This significantly improves **developer experience**, **portability**, and **operability** in real-world 
deployments.
