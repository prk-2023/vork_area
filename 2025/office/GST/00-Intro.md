# Development with GStreamer:

To learn Gstremaer for development especially with the eventual goal of using it with *Rust* the following are required. GStreamer is a powerful multimedia framework, and Rust bindings are maturing rapidly. Here's a structured path you can follow:

---
### Phase 1: Understand GStreamer Core (Use C or Python)

Before you jump into Rust, it's important to understand *how GStreamer works*, ideally using C or Python, because most of the documentation and tutorials are in these languages.

#### Step 1: Basics of GStreamer

* *What to learn:*

  * GStreamer architecture: pipelines, elements, pads, bins
  * Core concepts: sources, sinks, filters, caps, buffers
  * Simple pipeline creation and execution

* *Resources:*

  * [GStreamer Official Documentation](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/)
  * [GStreamer Tutorials (in C)](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/tutorials/index.html)
  * [GStreamer Python Bindings (`gi.repository.Gst`)](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gst-1.0/index.html)

#### Hands-on:

* Create basic pipelines (e.g., play audio/video files)
* Use `gst-launch-1.0` command-line tool to test pipelines quickly

---

### Phase 2: GStreamer Application Development (Still in C/Python)

Start building simple apps that:

* Create and run pipelines programmatically
* React to bus messages
* Handle errors
* Dynamically change pipelines

 Practice: Build an app that:

* Streams from a webcam
* Converts and saves video to disk
* Plays video with basic controls

---

### Phase 3: Learn Rust Basics (if not already familiar)

You’ll need to be comfortable with:

* Cargo and crates
* Ownership and borrowing
* Traits, enums, pattern matching
* Asynchronous programming (`tokio`, `futures`)

#### Rust Resources:

* [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
* [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)

---

### Phase 4: Jump into GStreamer with Rust

Once you're confident in both GStreamer concepts and Rust syntax, you can combine them.

#### Step 1: Set up Rust GStreamer Project

* Install required dependencies:

  ```sh
  sudo apt install libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev
  ```
* Add crates:

  ```toml
  [dependencies]
  gstreamer = "0.22"  # Check for the latest version
  gstreamer-video = "0.22"
  gstreamer-app = "0.22"
  ```

#### Step 2: Learn from Examples

* **Rust GStreamer Bindings Repo:**
  [https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer-rs/](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer-rs/)
* **Examples Directory:**
  [https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer-rs/-/tree/main/examples](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer-rs/-/tree/main/examples)

Explore examples like:

* Simple pipeline creation
* Video playback
* Stream processing with `appsink` and `appsrc`

#### Practice Projects in Rust:

* Media player
* Webcam recorder
* Video filter app (e.g., grayscale, invert)
* Network streaming (RTSP, WebRTC)

---

### Bonus: Real-world Integration

Once you're confident:

* Contribute to GStreamer-rs or plugins
* Build your own plugins in Rust (experimental, but doable)
* Combine GStreamer with Rust web frameworks like `actix-web` or `axum` for media apps

---

### Tools That Help

* `gst-launch-1.0` — test pipelines fast
* `gst-inspect-1.0` — discover elements and capabilities
* `GST_DEBUG` env var — for logging and debugging

---

# GObject and GLib:

Learning GStreamer does often involve working with *GObject* and *GLib*, since they form the foundation of GStreamer’s object system and utilities. Here’s a clear introduction to both:

---

## *GLib* — Core Utility Library

*GLib* is a low-level core library that provides:

* *Data types and utilities* (like dynamic arrays, hash tables, strings)
* *Main event loop support*
* *Threading and synchronization*
* *File and I/O abstraction*
* *Portable system calls*

### Why GLib?

* It standardizes behavior across platforms (Linux, Windows, etc.)
* It's lighter than libc++/STL, making it great for embedded systems
* It adds higher-level programming constructs in C

### Key GLib Components:

* `GList`, `GSList`: Singly and doubly linked lists
* `GHashTable`, `GTree`: Hash maps and trees
* `GString`: Mutable string type
* `GThread`, `GMutex`: Threading utilities
* `GMainLoop`: Core for event-driven programs (used heavily in GStreamer)

---

## *GObject* — Object System for C

*GObject* is an object-oriented framework built *on top of GLib* that brings *OOP features to C*, including:

* *Classes and instances*
* *Inheritance*
* *Interfaces*
* *Signals (similar to events or callbacks)*
* *Type system and runtime type checking*

### Why GObject?

* GStreamer and GTK use it for modular, extensible design
* Enables "classes" and polymorphism in plain C
* Supports *signals* for events (e.g., “pad-added” in GStreamer)

### Key GObject Concepts:

| Concept                             | Description                           |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `GObject`                           | Base class for all objects            |
| `G_TYPE_*`                          | Type system for runtime type checking |
| `g_signal_connect()`                | Connects callbacks to signals         |
| `g_object_set()` / `g_object_get()` | Set/get object properties             |
| `G_DEFINE_TYPE()`                   | Macro to define a new GObject class   |

---

### In the Context of GStreamer:

GStreamer elements are *GObjects*. You use:

* *GLib* for data handling and main loop
* *GObject* to create, configure, and manage pipeline elements
* *Signals* to respond to events like pad creation, bus messages, etc.

---

### Example: Using GObject in GStreamer

```c
g_signal_connect(pipeline, "message", G_CALLBACK(on_bus_message), NULL);
```

### Example: Using GLib

```c
GMainLoop *loop = g_main_loop_new(NULL, FALSE);
g_main_loop_run(loop);
```
---

### Summary

| Library   | Role                                                                              |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *GLib*    | Core utility functions, data structures, threading, and event loop                |
| *GObject* | Adds object-oriented programming features to C, used heavily in GStreamer and GTK |

---


# Example using GLib and GObjects:


*simple, minimal examples* you can run on Linux to test both *GLib* and *GObject* usage. These are great for getting familiar with how they work in a clean, self-contained way.

---

## 1. *GLib Example: Using `GMainLoop`*

This is a basic program that starts a main loop and quits after 3 seconds.

### `glib_mainloop_example.c`:

```c
#include <glib.h>

gboolean quit_loop(gpointer data) {
    GMainLoop *loop = (GMainLoop *)data;
    g_print("Timeout reached. Quitting loop.\n");
    g_main_loop_quit(loop);
    return FALSE;  // Don't call again
}

int main() {
    GMainLoop *loop = g_main_loop_new(NULL, FALSE);
    g_timeout_add_seconds(3, quit_loop, loop);
    g_print("Starting main loop. Will quit in 3 seconds...\n");
    g_main_loop_run(loop);
    g_main_loop_unref(loop);
    return 0;
}
```

### Compile and run:

```bash
gcc glib_mainloop_example.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs glib-2.0` -o glib_test
./glib_test
```

---

## 2. *GObject Example: Defining a Simple Class*

This defines a custom object with a method and property.

### `gobject_simple_class.c`:

```c
#include <glib-object.h>

/* Define MyObject class */
#define MY_TYPE_OBJECT my_object_get_type()
G_DECLARE_FINAL_TYPE(MyObject, my_object, MY, OBJECT, GObject)

struct _MyObject {
    GObject parent_instance;
    gint count;
};

G_DEFINE_TYPE(MyObject, my_object, G_TYPE_OBJECT)

/* Initialization */
static void my_object_class_init(MyObjectClass *klass) {}
static void my_object_init(MyObject *self) {
    self->count = 42;
}

MyObject* my_object_new() {
    return g_object_new(MY_TYPE_OBJECT, NULL);
}

void my_object_print(MyObject *self) {
    g_print("MyObject count: %d\n", self->count);
}

/* Main */
int main() {
    MyObject *obj = my_object_new();
    my_object_print(obj);
    g_object_unref(obj);
    return 0;
}
```

### Compile and run:

```bash
gcc gobject_simple_class.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs gobject-2.0` -o gobject_test
./gobject_test
```

You should see:

```
MyObject count: 42
```

---

## 🧪 Optional: Test GStreamer Element Creation

If you already have GStreamer installed, you can test GObject integration with it.

### `gstreamer_simple.c`:

```c
#include <gst/gst.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    gst_init(&argc, &argv);

    GstElement *pipeline = gst_pipeline_new("test-pipeline");
    GstElement *source = gst_element_factory_make("videotestsrc", "source");
    GstElement *sink = gst_element_factory_make("autovideosink", "sink");

    if (!pipeline || !source || !sink) {
        g_printerr("Failed to create GStreamer elements.\n");
        return -1;
    }

    gst_bin_add_many(GST_BIN(pipeline), source, sink, NULL);
    gst_element_link(source, sink);

    gst_element_set_state(pipeline, GST_STATE_PLAYING);
    g_print("Running pipeline for 5 seconds...\n");
    g_usleep(5 * G_USEC_PER_SEC);
    gst_element_set_state(pipeline, GST_STATE_NULL);

    gst_object_unref(pipeline);
    return 0;
}
```

### Compile and run:

```bash
gcc gstreamer_simple.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs gstreamer-1.0` -o gst_test
./gst_test
```

---

Let me know if you'd like to:

* Add **signals** in the GObject example
* Connect a **GStreamer bus callback**
* Build a **Makefile** for all of this

These are foundational stepping stones for working with GStreamer in real apps.
