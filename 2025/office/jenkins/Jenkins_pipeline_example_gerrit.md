### Jenkins Pipeline Tutorial: Using Podman, Gerrit Trigger, and Folder Filtering

In this tutorial, we'll walk through setting up Jenkins on a Linux machine using Podman, creating a Gerrit trigger for building a pipeline on commit, and limiting the pipeline to only trigger builds for changes in the `meta-example/recipe-graphics/` folder.

#### Prerequisites

- Linux machine (any distribution should work)
- **Podman** installed
- **Gerrit** server set up and connected with Jenkins
- **Jenkins** installed via Podman

#### Part 1: Setting Up Jenkins with Podman

First, we need to install and set up Jenkins using Podman. This will allow us to run Jenkins in a containerized environment.

1. **Install Podman** (if you don’t have it installed already):
   - For **Ubuntu** or **Debian**:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install -y podman
     ```

   - For **CentOS** or **RHEL**:
     ```bash
     sudo yum install -y podman
     ```

2. **Run Jenkins in a Podman container**:
   The official Jenkins Docker image can be used with Podman since Podman supports Docker images.
   ```bash
   podman run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 --name jenkins jenkins/jenkins:lts
   ```

   This command will:
   - Pull the Jenkins LTS image.
   - Run Jenkins in a detached container.
   - Expose Jenkins on ports 8080 (for web interface) and 50000 (for agent communication).

3. **Access Jenkins**:
   Once the container is running, access Jenkins by visiting `http://localhost:8080` in your browser. You’ll be prompted to unlock Jenkins.

   - To get the initial admin password, run the following command:
     ```bash
     podman logs jenkins
     ```

   - Copy the password and enter it into the web interface to complete the setup.

#### Part 2: Install Required Jenkins Plugins

You’ll need the following Jenkins plugins:
- **Gerrit Trigger Plugin**: For triggering builds based on changes in Gerrit.
- **Pipeline Plugin**: To write Jenkins pipelines.
- **Git Plugin**: To check out the code from your repository.

1. Go to **Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins**.
2. Search for the plugins listed above and install them.

#### Part 3: Create a Jenkins Pipeline Job

Now that Jenkins is set up, let’s create a Jenkins pipeline job that will be triggered by Gerrit changes.

1. **Create a new pipeline job**:
   - In Jenkins, go to the homepage and click on **New Item**.
   - Name your job (e.g., `gerrit-trigger-pipeline`).
   - Select **Pipeline** and click **OK**.

2. **Configure the Gerrit Trigger**:
   - In the job configuration page, scroll down to **Gerrit Trigger**.
   - Enable **Trigger on change events**.
   - Under **Gerrit project**, specify the project/repository to watch (e.g., `project-name`).
   - Under **Branch**, specify the branch for the trigger (e.g., `refs/heads/master` or any other branch).

3. **Configure the Pipeline script**:
   Scroll to the **Pipeline** section and enter the following script to define the pipeline.

#### Part 4: Pipeline Script Example

Here’s a simple example of a Jenkinsfile pipeline script that triggers a build only when changes occur in the `meta-example/recipe-graphics/` folder.

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    triggers {
        gerrit(triggerOn: 'change-merged', gerritProject: 'project-name') // Trigger on merged changes
    }

    stages {
        stage('Check for Folder Change') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Get the list of changed files from Gerrit
                    def changedFiles = sh(script: "git diff --name-only ${GERRIT_COMMITTER_REVISION}~1 ${GERRIT_COMMITTER_REVISION}", returnStdout: true).trim().split("\n")
                    
                    // Filter the files to check if any are in the 'meta-example/recipe-graphics/' folder
                    def folderChanged = changedFiles.any { it.startsWith('meta-example/recipe-graphics/') }

                    // If no files in the folder changed, abort the build
                    if (!folderChanged) {
                        currentBuild.result = 'SUCCESS'
                        error("No changes in 'meta-example/recipe-graphics/' folder, skipping build.")
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Build') {
            when {
                expression { return currentBuild.result != 'SUCCESS' }  // Only run this stage if no errors in the folder check
            }
            steps {
                // Add your build commands here, e.g., build the application or run tests
                echo 'Building the project...'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Explanation of the Pipeline:

1. **Gerrit Trigger**:
   - The `gerrit` block triggers the build whenever a change is merged into the specified project.
   
2. **Check for Folder Change**:
   - We use `git diff` to find the files changed in the latest commit.
   - If any of the files are within the `meta-example/recipe-graphics/` folder, the pipeline proceeds to the build stage.
   - If no changes are found in this folder, the pipeline will abort, skipping the build.

3. **Build Stage**:
   - This is where the actual build or deployment commands would go. In this example, it's just a placeholder echo statement.

#### Part 5: Set Up the Gerrit Trigger in Jenkins

1. **Configure the Gerrit Server**:
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins > Configure System**.
   - Scroll to **Gerrit Trigger** settings.
   - Set up your **Gerrit Server** connection by specifying the host URL and authentication details.

2. **Link the Gerrit Trigger Plugin to the Job**:
   - When configuring the job, select the Gerrit trigger settings (as mentioned above) to tie the job to the Gerrit project.

#### Part 6: Testing

1. **Push Changes to Gerrit**:
   - Make a commit in the `meta-example/recipe-graphics/` folder.
   - Push the change to Gerrit.

2. **Verify Build in Jenkins**:
   - The Jenkins job should be triggered and a build should begin if the change is related to the specified folder. If no change is made in that folder, the build will be skipped.

---

### Conclusion

You’ve now set up Jenkins with Podman, configured a Gerrit trigger, and added a filter to only trigger the build when changes occur in a specific folder (`meta-example/recipe-graphics/`). This setup ensures that Jenkins only runs builds for relevant changes, optimizing your CI/CD workflow.

# Q2> Jenkins integrates with Gerrit to provide continuous integration (CI) for code changes. 

## Ans>

In a **Gerrit** development environment, Jenkins integrates with Gerrit to provide continuous integration (CI) for code changes. Gerrit is a code review tool that facilitates peer review of source code changes before they are merged into the main codebase. Jenkins automates the build, test, and deployment process after code is reviewed and changes are approved.

Here’s a breakdown of how Jenkins works in a Gerrit environment:

### **1. Overview of Gerrit Workflow**

Gerrit allows developers to push code changes to a **Gerrit server**, where the code undergoes peer review. 
These changes are not merged directly into the main branch until they have been reviewed and approved by 
other developers.

- **Code Push**: 
    Developers push their code changes to a remote Git repository managed by Gerrit. 
    These changes are pushed as **Gerrit changesets**, which are not yet merged into the main codebase.

- **Code Review**: 
    Gerrit facilitates code review by allowing reviewers to comment on the changes, approve them, or reject 
    them. Each change gets an associated **change ID**.

- **Approval**: 
    Once the code passes review and gets approved, the changes are merged into the main branch.

### **2. How Jenkins Integrates with Gerrit**

Jenkins works in tandem with Gerrit by responding to changes in Gerrit (i.e., new code pushes or reviews) 
to trigger jobs that build and test the code. 

Here’s a step-by-step explanation of the Jenkins-Gerrit workflow:
---

#### **Step 1: Jenkins Gerrit Trigger Plugin**

The **Jenkins Gerrit Trigger plugin** enables Jenkins to interact with Gerrit, listening for events such as:

- **New patches** (when new code changes are pushed to Gerrit).
- **Code reviews** (when reviews are added to changes).
- **Patch set creation** (when a developer pushes new versions of a change).
- **Change approval** (when a change is approved for merging into the main branch).

You need to install the **Gerrit Trigger Plugin** on Jenkins to set up this integration.

##### Steps to install Gerrit Trigger Plugin:

1. Go to **Manage Jenkins** -> **Manage Plugins**.
2. Under the **Available** tab, search for **Gerrit Trigger Plugin**.
3. Install the plugin and restart Jenkins.

---

#### **Step 2: Configure Jenkins Job for Gerrit Integration**

Once the Gerrit Trigger Plugin is installed, you need to configure Jenkins to listen for Gerrit events.

1. **Create a New Jenkins Job**:

   - Go to **New Item** in Jenkins and create a **Freestyle project** or **Pipeline** (depending on your 
     preference).

2. **Configure Gerrit Trigger**:

   - In the job configuration page, scroll to the **Gerrit Trigger** section.
   - Check **Build when a change is pushed to Gerrit**.
   - Set up your **Gerrit server** by adding the Gerrit connection details, such as the server address and 
     authentication details (username, SSH key, or HTTP credentials).

3. **Define Event Triggering**:

   - In the **Gerrit Trigger** configuration, specify the events that should trigger Jenkins builds:
     - **Patchset Created**: Trigger the build when a new patchset is created for a change.
     - **Change Merged**: Trigger the build after a change has been merged into the main branch.
     - **Change Abandoned**: Trigger the build if a change is abandoned.
   - You can specify **specific branches** (like `master` or `develop`) to only listen to changes on those 
     branches.

4. **Configure Git**:
   - In the **Source Code Management** section of the Jenkins job, configure the Git repository URL. 
     This should point to your **Gerrit-hosted Git repository**.

---

#### **Step 3: Gerrit Review and Jenkins Triggering**

Here’s how the actual interaction works after the job is set up:

1. **Developer Pushes Code**: A developer pushes a new change to the Gerrit repository.
   - The change is automatically assigned a **change ID** and is put into **Code Review** status.
   - At this point, **no merge occurs** yet. The change only exists in Gerrit’s review space.

2. **Jenkins Picks Up the Change**: The Gerrit Trigger Plugin in Jenkins detects the new patchset.
   - Jenkins pulls the change from the Gerrit repository using the change ID.
   - Jenkins triggers a **build** (e.g., it could compile the code, run unit tests, etc.).

3. **Build Results in Gerrit**:
   - After Jenkins completes the build and test, it reports the results back to **Gerrit**.
   - Jenkins can send a **comment** or **score** (such as a +1 for successful builds or -1 for failed builds) on the change.
   - This feedback is visible to reviewers in Gerrit, and it helps reviewers decide whether to approve or reject the change.
   - If Jenkins finds errors or test failures, the code reviewer may reject or request changes.

4. **Code Review and Approval**:
   - Once the code passes the review (which includes Jenkins build results), a reviewer can approve the change in Gerrit.
   - After the change is approved, it can be merged into the main branch in the Gerrit repository.

5. **Post-Merge Jobs (Optional)**:
   - Once the change is merged into the main branch, Jenkins can trigger further jobs to deploy, test, or perform any post-merge actions.

##### More detailed flow:

For the **Jenkins Gerrit Trigger Plugin** to work correctly, Jenkins needs permission to interact with the 
Gerrit repository, particularly to fetch the patchset and submit feedback. 
This usually involves adding the **Jenkins user** as a **reviewer** or **approver** in Gerrit.

Here’s how you can ensure Jenkins has the necessary permissions:

### **1. Set Up a Gerrit User for Jenkins**

When you integrate Jenkins with Gerrit, Jenkins needs access to the Gerrit repository to fetch code changes 
and push back results (e.g., build statuses, feedback). For this, you need to configure a **Gerrit user** 
for Jenkins.

This user will be responsible for:

- **Fetching patchsets** (new changes).
- **Posting comments** (build results).
- **Voting on changes** (e.g., approve with a +1 or reject with a -1 if the build fails).

### **2. Add Jenkins User as Reviewer**

- **Permissions**: 
    The **Jenkins user** should have **read** access to the repository and the ability to leave feedback on 
    the changes. Gerrit usually requires the Jenkins user to have at least the **Reviewer** role to vote on 
    changes and post comments.
  
You can create a dedicated Gerrit account for Jenkins and add this user as a **reviewer** on all changes. 
This can be done automatically by the Gerrit plugin or manually by adding Jenkins as a reviewer for changes.

### **Steps to Create and Set Permissions for Jenkins User in Gerrit:**

1. **Create a Gerrit User for Jenkins**:
   - If you don't already have a dedicated user for Jenkins, create a user in Gerrit with a unique username
     (e.g., `jenkins`).
   - This can typically be done through the Gerrit web interface or by using the **Gerrit API**.

2. **Assign Gerrit Permissions**:
   - The Jenkins user should have permission to **read** the Git repository and to post comments or votes 
     on changes.
   - In Gerrit, this can be configured under **Access Control** for the repository:
     - Navigate to **Project Settings** in the Gerrit interface.
     - Under **Access**, add the Jenkins user with **Read** access to the repository.
     - Optionally, add the Jenkins user as a **Code-Reviewer** if you want Jenkins to post approval comments 
       after builds (e.g., `+1` for success, `-1` for failure).
   
3. **Configure the Gerrit Trigger Plugin**:
   - In Jenkins, when setting up the **Gerrit Trigger Plugin**, you will need to provide credentials 
     (e.g., SSH key or HTTP credentials) for the Jenkins user to authenticate with the Gerrit server.
   - Make sure these credentials are correctly configured so that Jenkins can pull changes and post feedback.
   
   The plugin can be set to:
   - **Automatically add Jenkins as a reviewer** (by using the `Gerrit Trigger` plugin’s option).
   - **Submit feedback** (like +1 or -1) based on build status.

4. **Review Settings**:
   - Ensure that Jenkins can fetch the **change ID** and **patchset** using the configured **credentials**.
   - Once a patchset is detected, Jenkins will use these credentials to fetch the code and, after the 
     build/test process, post a comment or a vote back to Gerrit.

### **3. Permissions Example in Gerrit:**

Here’s an example of a simple **permissions configuration** for the Jenkins user in Gerrit:

- **Read**: Jenkins needs **read access** to fetch the changes.
- **Write/Push**: Jenkins may also need **write permissions** to post the build results 
    (e.g., a +1 or -1 vote or comments).
- **Reviewer**: Jenkins should be added as a **reviewer** to leave feedback 
    (like “successful build” or “failing build”).
  
### **4. Why Jenkins Needs to Be a Reviewer**

The Gerrit Trigger Plugin will listen for changes and **pull** them into Jenkins for building/testing. 
But for Jenkins to post feedback back into Gerrit (e.g., a **+1 vote** on the patchset after a successful 
build), it needs to be listed as a reviewer. This ensures that the Jenkins user can **comment** on the 
change and **vote** to approve or reject the change based on build results.

---

### **Summary**

- **Yes**, you do need to configure the **Jenkins user** in Gerrit with appropriate permissions, 
  typically adding the Jenkins user as a **reviewer** with **read access** and **review/voting** permissions.
- The Jenkins user must also have the right credentials (SSH keys or HTTP) set up in both **Gerrit** and 
  **Jenkins** to fetch changes and submit feedback.

Once you have these configurations in place, the **Jenkins Gerrit Trigger Plugin** will be able to 
automatically pick up patchsets, trigger builds, and post feedback to Gerrit.

---

### **3. Common Gerrit-Jenkins Workflow**

Here is a more detailed flow of the interaction between Gerrit and Jenkins:

1. **Developer Pushes to Gerrit**: 
   - A developer pushes a change to Gerrit for review.
   
2. **Jenkins Detects Patchset**:
   - The Gerrit Trigger Plugin listens for the new change and automatically starts the Jenkins job.

3. **Jenkins Builds and Tests**:
   - Jenkins builds the change (e.g., compiles code, runs tests).

4. **Jenkins Feedback to Gerrit**:
   - Jenkins reports the build status back to Gerrit.
   - It might send comments or a +1/-1 score depending on the build result.

5. **Code Reviewers Approve or Reject**:
   - Reviewers inspect the change, view Jenkins feedback, and approve or request modifications.
   
6. **Merge to Main Branch**:
   - Once approved, the change is merged into the main branch of the repository.
   - Jenkins can be triggered to perform further actions (such as deploying or running post-merge tests).

---

### **4. Benefits of Jenkins with Gerrit**

- **Automated Build and Test**: Jenkins helps automate the build and test process, ensuring that changes don’t break the codebase.
- **Faster Feedback**: With each change, developers receive immediate feedback on whether their code works or not, improving the development cycle.
- **Improved Code Quality**: Continuous integration ensures that all code is reviewed, built, and tested before being merged, improving code quality.
- **Seamless Code Review**: Gerrit streamlines the code review process, and Jenkins ensures that only passing code gets merged.

---

### **5. Conclusion**

In a Gerrit development environment, Jenkins plays a critical role in automating the CI/CD pipeline by 
providing automated builds and tests for changes that are under review. By using **Gerrit Trigger Plugin**, 
Jenkins can be configured to automatically pull changes when new code is pushed, perform builds, run tests, 
and report feedback back to Gerrit. This integration helps improve code quality, reduces manual errors, and 
speeds up the development process.
