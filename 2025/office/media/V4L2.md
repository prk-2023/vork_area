# V4L2:


## Introduction: ( with v4l2-m2m as focus )

The **V4L2 (Video4Linux2)** subsystem in the Linux kernel is an important framework for video capture and 
output devices. 

It provides an API for video device drivers and applications to interact with hardware devices that handle 
video data. When discussing **M2M (Memory-to-Memory)** devices in the context of V4L2, we focus on devices 
that perform operations on video data stored in memory rather than devices that capture data from a 
physical input source like a camera.

### 1.1 **Overview of V4L2**

V4L2 is the second version of the Video for Linux API, and it is a part of the Linux kernel that 
standardizes the interaction between video devices and applications. It includes a set of interfaces for 
capturing, processing, encoding, decoding, and outputting video data.

V4L2 supports a variety of devices, such as:

- **Video capture devices** (e.g., webcams, TV tuners)
- **Video output devices** (e.g., display adapters, TV-out devices)
- **Video processing devices** (e.g., video encoders/decoders, video mixers)

### 1.2 **M2M Devices in V4L2**

M2M devices are video processing devices where the input and output buffers reside in memory rather than 
from a physical capture device (like a camera or TV tuner). 
These devices are responsible for operations such as video encoding/decoding, video format conversion, 
scaling, and other transformations.

**M2M devices** in the V4L2 context are often used for:

- Video codecs (e.g., H.264, HEVC) for encoding or decoding video streams.
- Image processing tasks, such as scaling, color-space conversion, etc.
- Video transcoding, where video streams are converted from one format to another.

The **M2M model** allows the video data to be passed between the memory buffers rather than through a 
physical capture or display device. This interaction model is quite different from the traditional 
**capture-and-output** devices, where data flows from the device (e.g., camera) to the application, and 
then to the output.

### 1.3 **V4L2 M2M Device Architecture**

1. **M2M Device Driver**:

    The M2M device is represented by a driver in the kernel. 
    This driver interacts with the hardware to perform video transformations. 
    The hardware may be a dedicated video processor or a software-based encoder/decoder. 
    The driver provides an interface for applications to queue memory buffers (with video data), process 
    these buffers, and retrieve the processed data.

2. **V4L2 Subsystems in M2M Devices**:

    - **Capture**: 
        This represents the "input" side of the device, where data is queued to be processed. 
        For example, a video decoding device would capture a video stream in a certain format.

    - **Output**: 
        This represents the "output" side, where processed video data is available after the transformation.
        After a codec has decoded the video, it can be retrieved for further processing or display.

3. **Buffers**:

    M2M devices utilize memory buffers that store video data. 
    Buffers are used to exchange data between user-space applications and the kernel-space driver. 
    These buffers are typically allocated in memory, and the driver handles their processing. 
    In M2M operations, both input and output buffers are allocated and handled by the kernel.

    - **Capture Buffers**: 
        These hold incoming video data that needs to be processed (ex encoded/decoded video).

    - **Output Buffers**: 
        After processing, the device writes the result to these buffers (ex the output of the decoded video).

4. **V4L2 IOCTLs and Operations**:

    V4L2 uses a series of **ioctl** (input/output control) system calls to interact with video devices. 
    These ioctls allow applications to set device parameters, start or stop streaming, and manage buffers.

    - **VIDIOC_REQBUFS**: Used to request buffers for both capture and output.
    - **VIDIOC_QUERYBUF**: Queries information about a buffer.
    - **VIDIOC_QBUF** and **VIDIOC_DQBUF**: Queue and dequeue buffers to/from the device for processing.
    - **VIDIOC_STREAMON** and **VIDIOC_STREAMOFF**: Start and stop streaming operations.

    M2M devices often use a special variant of these ioctls that manage capture and o/p buffers independently.

5. **Queueing Mechanism**:

    The kernel’s V4L2 subsystem utilizes a queue mechanism for managing buffers. 
    For M2M devices:
        - Buffers are queued to either the **capture queue** or the **output queue**.
        - The driver processes the capture queue and produces results in the output queue.
        - Applications can poll, select, or wait on these queues to monitor the availability of data.

6. **Processing Pipelines**:

    M2M devices can form part of a processing pipeline. A typical M2M use case involves multiple 
    transformations, such as:

    - Decoding a compressed video stream (e.g., H.264)
    - Processing (e.g., scaling, color conversion)
    - Encoding the processed video to a different format (e.g., H.265)

    Each of these steps can be handled by different M2M devices or the same M2M device, depending on the 
    complexity of the pipeline.

### 1.4 **V4L2 M2M Operation Flow**

1. **Application Side**:

    The application allocates memory buffers using the `VIDIOC_REQBUFS` ioctl. 
    These buffers are then mapped into user space and filled with data.
   
2. **Capture Queue**:

    The application feeds input data (e.g., a raw frame or compressed video stream) into the M2M device’s 
    **capture queue** by calling `VIDIOC_QBUF`. 
    This data is usually provided as raw video or compressed video for processing.

3. **Processing**:

    The M2M device (video codec or processing unit) starts processing the captured data. 
    This could involve decoding, scaling, color conversion, or encoding.
   
4. **Output Queue**:

    Once the data is processed, the M2M device places the output into the **output queue**. 
    The application can then access the processed data (e.g., decoded video or encoded video) by calling 
    `VIDIOC_DQBUF`.

5. **Streaming Control**:

    The application can control the streaming process using `VIDIOC_STREAMON` and `VIDIOC_STREAMOFF` to 
    start and stop the capture and output process, respectively.

### 1.5 **V4L2 M2M Use Cases**

Some typical use cases of M2M devices in V4L2 are:

    - **Video Decoding**: 
        A hardware decoder that decodes compressed video (e.g., H.264 or HEVC) and outputs raw video frames.

    - **Video Encoding**: 
        A hardware encoder that compresses raw video frames into a compressed format (e.g., H.264 or HEVC).

    - **Transcoding**: 
        Converting a video stream from one fmt to another, possibly involving both decoding&encoding stages.

    - **Image Processing**: 
        Performing operations like scaling, color-space conversion, and format conversion on video frames.

### 1.6 **M2M vs. Traditional Video Capture Devices**

    - **M2M**: 
        Focuses on memory-based input and output, dealing with video data that is already in memory.

    - **Capture Devices**: 
        Typically read video data directly from hardware sensors (ex: camera or TV tuner) and provide video
        data directly to the system.

### 1.7 **Challenges and Considerations**

    - **Synchronization**: 
        Handling timing and synchronization between the capture and output queues is crucial in 
        M2M operations, especially in real-time video processing scenarios.

    - **Buffer Management**: 
        Efficient buffer management is critical for avoiding memory issues and ensuring smooth data 
        transfer between user space and kernel space.

    - **Hardware Support**: 
        M2M devices may require specialized hardware support, and not all video devices are M2M-capable.

### 1.8 **Conclusion**

    The **V4L2 M2M subsystem** provides a flexible and efficient way to handle video processing operations 
    entirely in memory. 
    Devices that fall under this category typically deal with video encoding, decoding, transcoding, and 
    other transformations. 
    This makes V4L2 M2M ideal for scenarios where video data is already available in memory and needs to be 
    processed, as opposed to capturing raw video from a sensor or outputting it to a display. 
    Understanding this system is essential for developing applications involving video codecs, 
    image processing, and transcoding.
