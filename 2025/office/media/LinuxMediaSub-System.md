# Media Sub-System :

### Introduction:

Linux media Sub-System is a framework that is designed to handle multimedia devices ( ex: cameras, video
capture cards, TV Tuners, HDMI interfaces..) and manage complex hardware pipelines.

Its Main job is to handle the low-level hardware and provide API's for user-space to interact with these
devices.

Below is the detailed breakdown of its architecture, components, and workflow:

#### 1. Key components of the Media Sub-System:

a) Media Controller API:

    - Purpose: Manages complex hardware pipelines (ex: camera sensors, connected to image processor via
      buses like I2C/CSI-2 ).

    - Core Concepts: 
        - Entities: Represent HW blocks ( sensors, encoders, decoders, DMA Engines ).
        - Pads: Connection points to the Entities (Ex: Input/Output pads for data flow ).
        - Links: Connections between pads ( define how data flows between Entities ).
    
    Ex: A camera sensor (entity) sends video data via a CSI-2 bus (link) to an image processor (entity).

b) V4L2: 

    - Purpose: Standardize video captue, Output, and overlay opeartions (ex: webcameras, HDMI capture
      cards).

    - Features: 
        - Device nodes: /dev/videoX

                                  +-------------------------+

#### Workflow Example: Camera Pipeline:

a) Hardware Setup:

    - HW setup: 
        Camera sensors -> CSI-2 Interface -> Image Signal Processor (ISP) -> Memory.

    - Media Controller Configuration:
        Define entities (sensor, ISP, DMA).
        Link pads: sensor:output -> ISP:input, ISP:output -> DMA:input.

    - User-Space Interaction:
        Use media-ctl to configure links and formats:

        ` media-ctl -d /dev/media0 -l "'sensor':1 -> 'ISP':0 [1]" `
        ` media-ctl -d /dev/media0 -V "'sensor':1 [fmt:UYVY/1920x1080]" `

#### Key Tools and Interfaces:

a) Media Controller Tools

    media-ctl: Configures media pipelines (links, formats).
    v4l2-ctl: Controls V4L2 devices (e.g., set resolution, capture frames).

b) Device Nodes

    Media Controller: /dev/mediaX.
    V4L2: /dev/videoX.
    DVB: /dev/dvb/adapterX.

c) Debugging

    dmesg: Check kernel logs for device registration errors.
    v4l2-compliance: Validate V4L2 device compliance.

#### Advanced Features:

    - Dynamic pipelines and re-configuration: modify links/formats at runtime.
    - Multiplanar Formats: Support for complex formats line NV12 
    - DMABUF Integration: Zero-Copy Buffer sharing between devices (ex: GPU, and Camera )


#### HDMI Capture workflow:

    - Hardware: HDMI source -> Capture Card -> PCIe bus.
    - Kernel Setup:
        - Media Controller links HDMI receiver to DMA engine.
        - V4L2 Exposes /dev/video0 for capture.
    - User-Space:

        # Set HDMI input format
        `v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 --set-fmt-video=width=1920,height=1080,pixelformat=YUYV`
        # Capture frames
        `ffmpeg -f v4l2 -i /dev/video0 output.mp4`

#### Challenges :

    - HW Diversity: Drivers must abstract vendor-specific details.
    - Latency: Real-time pipeline require careful buffer management.
    - Security: Validate user-space input to prevent kernel exploits.

#### Use-cases:

    - Cameras: Smartphones, drones, surveillance systems.
    - TV Tuners: Digital broadcasting, set-top boxes.
    - Video Processing: FPGA-based encoders/decoders.

The Linux media subsystem provides a unified framework to manage multimedia devices and complex data 
pipelines. 
By combining V4L2, media controller, and DVB, it enables robust support for modern multimedia hardware while
exposing user-friendly APIs for applications. 

Developers can use tools like media-ctl and v4l2-ctl to configure and debug these systems efficiently.



### Role of Media Controller for VPU-Based Encoder/Decoder:

MC API is highly useful for managing encoder/decoder hardware (e.g., a dedicated VPU)) that uses remoteproc
to boot firmware, especially when integrated with the V4L2 (Video4Linux2) subsystem. 
Here’s how these components work together and why the MC API is critical:

---

####  Media Controller (MC) API

A VPU with remoteproc firmware typically handles video encoding/decoding in a hardware-accelerated manner 
(e.g., H.264, HEVC). 

The MC API helps manage the VPU as part of a larger media pipeline, even if the VPU is a standalone entity.

#### Key Use Cases:
- Pipeline Configuration: Define how the VPU connects to other entities 
    (e.g., camera sensors, memory buffers, or display controllers).
- Format Negotiation: Set input/output formats (e.g., resolution, pixel format) between the VPU and other 
    hardware blocks.
- Dynamic Control: Modify encoder/decoder settings (e.g., bitrate, GOP size) at runtime.

---

### Integration with V4L2
The V4L2 subsystem exposes the VPU as a `/dev/videoX` device node, allowing user-space applications 
(e.g., GStreamer, FFmpeg) to interact with it. The MC API complements V4L2 by:

    - Abstracting Hardware Complexity: Representing the VPU and its firmware as a media entity with 
      input/output pads.
    - Managing Bufs:Coordinating DMABUF or MMAP buffers between the VPU and other devices(ex cameras,GPUs).

---

### Workflow Example: VPU Encoding Pipeline
1. Hardware Setup:
   - Camera → ISP (Image Signal Processor) → VPU (encoder) → Memory.
   - VPU firmware is loaded via **remoteproc** (e.g., using `sysfs` or `remoteproc` kernel APIs).

2. Media Controller Configuration:
   - Define entities: `camera`, `ISP`, `VPU`, `memory`.
   - Link pads: `camera:output → ISP:input`, `ISP:output → VPU:input`, `VPU:output → memory:input`.
   - Set formats:
     ```bash
     media-ctl -d /dev/media0 -V "VPU:input [fmt:YUYV/1920x1080]"
     media-ctl -d /dev/media0 -V "VPU:output [fmt:H264/1920x1088]"
     ```

3. V4L2 Interaction:
   - Use `v4l2-ctl` to set encoder parameters (e.g., bitrate, profile):
     ```bash
     v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 --set-ctrl video_bitrate=5000000
     ```
   - Stream encoded video via `V4L2_MEMORY_MMAP` or `V4L2_MEMORY_DMABUF`.

---

### Why Media Controller is Useful for VPUs
- Pipeline Abstraction: 
    The VPU can be treated as a "black box" within a larger media pipeline, simplifying application logic.

- Firmware Isolation: 
    The remoteproc-managed VPU firmware is abstracted via MC entities, reducing user-space complexity.

- Format Negotiation: 
    Ensures compatibility between the VPU and upstream/downstream components (ex a camera’s output format 
    matches the VPU’s input requirements).

---

### Remoteproc and VPU Firmware
- Remoteproc: Loads and manages the VPU firmware (e.g., `vpu-firmware.bin`).
- Communication**: The VPU and main CPU communicate via **RPMSG** (Remote Processor Messaging) or shared memory.
- Integration with MC:
  - The VPU driver registers itself as a media entity.
  - Firmware-specific controls (e.g., codec parameters) are exposed via V4L2 controls.

---

### Example: Decoding with a VPU
1. Hardware Setup:
   - Encoded stream (e.g., H.264 file) → VPU (decoder) → Display controller.

2. Media Controller Configuration:
   ```bash
   media-ctl -d /dev/media0 -l "'VPU':1 -> 'display':0 [1]"
   media-ctl -d /dev/media0 -V "'VPU':1 [fmt:YUYV/1920x1080]"
   ```

3. V4L2 Commands:

   ```#Set decoder input format (H.264)```
   ```v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 --set-fmt-video=width=1920,height=1080,pixelformat=H264```
   ```#Stream decoded frames to display```
   ```ffmpeg -f v4l2 -i /dev/video0 -f fbdev /dev/fb0```

---

### Benefits of Media Controller + V4L2

- Unified Interface: 
    Applications interact with the VPU via standard V4L2 APIs, regardless of firmware/remoteproc details.
- Pipeline Flexibility: 
    Reconfigure the VPU’s role (encoder/decoder) dynamically.
- Tooling Support: 
    Use `media-ctl`, `v4l2-ctl`, and GStreamer’s `v4l2` plugins.

---

### Challenges
- Firmware-Specific Quirks: Some VPUs require custom controls not covered by V4L2 standards.
- Latency: Buffering between remoteproc-managed VPU and other entities must be optimized.
- Debugging: Use `dmesg` and `v4l2-compliance` to troubleshoot pipeline issues.

---

### Conclusion

-
For a VPU-based encoder/decoder managed via remoteproc, the Media Controller API is essential to integrate 
the VPU into a V4L2-centric media pipeline. 
It abstracts firmware/hardware complexities, enabling seamless interaction with user-space applications 
while leveraging Linux’s standard multimedia frameworks. 
This setup is widely used in embedded systems (e.g., drones, set-top boxes) and is supported by platforms 
like TI OMAP, NXP i.MX, and Qualcomm Snapdragon.
