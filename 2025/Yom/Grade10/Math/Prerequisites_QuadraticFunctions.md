# Quadratic Functions:

Scope Grade 10:
1. Transformations of Quadratic functions
2. Characteristics of Quadratic functions
3. Focus of a Parabola 
4. Modeling with Quadratic Functions


Before diving into the topics listed, topics that need a solid grasp of several **prerequisite skills** and 
**conceptual foundations**. 

Let’s break them down clearly:

---

## **Prerequisites for Learning Quadratic Functions**

### **1. Algebraic Foundations**

You should already be comfortable with:

* **Simplifying algebraic expressions**

  * Combining like terms
  * Expanding brackets (e.g. ( (x + 3)(x - 2) ))

* **Factoring** quadratic and other polynomials

  * Common factor method
  * Difference of squares: ( a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b) )
  * Simple trinomials: ( x^2 + bx + c )
  * Complex trinomials: ( ax^2 + bx + c ) (where ( a \neq 1 ))

* **Solving linear equations and inequalities**

  * Single-variable equations (e.g. ( 3x + 5 = 11 ))
  * Equations with fractions or parentheses

> **Why:** 
> You’ll use factoring and algebraic manipulation constantly to find zeros, vertex forms, and 
  transformations of quadratics.

### **2. Functions and Graphs Basics**

You should understand:

* The concept of a **function**: input → output
* How to **substitute** values into a function (e.g. evaluate ( f(2) ) when ( f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 2 ))
* **Graphing linear functions** and recognizing slope & intercept
* **Coordinate plane basics** — plotting points (x, y) accurately

> **Why:** 
> Quadratic functions build directly on the idea of linear functions, but the shape becomes a **parabola** 
> instead of a straight line.

---

### **3. Exponents and Powers**

You should know:

* The **laws of exponents**, e.g.:

  * ( a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n} )
  * ( (a^m)^n = a^{mn} )
* Squaring numbers and variables (e.g. ( (x + 3)^2 = x^2 + 6x + 9 ))

> **Why:** 
> The quadratic term ( x^2 ) is what defines a parabola — understanding how exponents work is essential.

---

### **4. Geometry Connections**

Helpful geometric ideas include:

* **The Cartesian coordinate system**
* **Symmetry** (especially reflective symmetry)
* **Distance formula** (optional but helpful for the focus and directrix)
* **Vertex as a point** on a graph — understanding what coordinates represent

> **Why:** The geometric meaning of a parabola (points equidistant from a focus and directrix) connects 
> algebra to geometry.

---

### **5. Problem-Solving and Modeling Skills**

You should have experience with:

* **Word problems** that involve setting up equations
* **Interpreting graphs** (e.g. what intercepts mean in context)
* **Creating equations from situations**

> **Why:** “Modeling with Quadratic Functions” asks you to describe real-world phenomena (like projectile motion) using quadratic equations.

##  **If You Want to Be Fully Prepared**

Before starting Quadratic Functions, make sure you can confidently do these:

| Skill                  | Example                                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Expand binomials       | ( (x + 5)^2 = x^2 + 10x + 25 )            |
| Factor trinomials      | ( x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3) )         |
| Solve simple equations | ( 3x - 7 = 11 \Rightarrow x = 6 )         |
| Graph linear functions | ( y = 2x + 3 )                            |
| Substitute values      | If ( f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3 ), find ( f(2) ) |
