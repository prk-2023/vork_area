Great — helping your student build fluency under time pressure (20-25 problems in 45 minutes) is a very worthwhile goal. Since you’re a physics teacher and your student is working on the Big Ideas Math: Algebra 2 Chapter 3 topic of complex numbers, here are two parts of a plan + suggested books (for the student and for you) that align with Singapore / IIT / “extra-practice” style.

---

## ✅ Strategy for your lesson + student practice

Here’s how you might structure the work so that your student both *understands* the material and builds speed.

### 1. Review the fundamentals

Go over the core concepts of complex numbers (as your book covers 3.2 “Complex Numbers”, 3.3 “Completing the Square” etc.). Make sure the student is fluent with:

* form (a + bi) and operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
* conjugate, modulus, argument (if your curriculum includes)
* solving quadratic equations with complex roots (since they link with Chapter 3)
* converting between forms (if polar form appears)
* interpreting complex roots in the context of your Algebra 2 curriculum (even if you don’t go deeply into complex plane geometry)

### 2. Practice deliberately

Because the issue is time + volume, you’ll want many short practice sets (10–15 problems) done under timed conditions, building up to 20-25 in ~45 minutes. For each set:

* mix easier and harder questions (so the student builds speed and confidence)
* include some exam-style/quiz-style questions (with complex number operations, roots, maybe application)
* after each set, go through *errors and slow questions* to see where time was lost (e.g., arithmetic mistakes, mis-applying formulas, not rewriting standard form, etc.)
* gradually reduce scaffolding: first you might provide hints or structured steps, later let the student work fully on their own under time.

### 3. Measure & reflect

* Use timed “mini-quizzes” (e.g., 10-15 problems in 20 minutes) regularly to build speed.
* Keep track of which sub-topics cause the student the most delay (e.g., division of complex numbers, roots of unity, etc).
* Reflect on *how* the time was used: Did they spend too long on one question? Did they have to rewrite many questions?

### 4. Build up to the full quiz/test

As the final step, simulate the full test: 20-25 problems in 45 minutes. Afterwards, review thoroughly: what took too long, where did they lose points, how can they improve pacing next time.

## 📚 Book Recommendations

Here are **good books** you might use for extra material/practice on complex numbers (both for you to pick questions and for the student to work on). Some are “Singapore style”, some are “IIT style”/competitive, so you can choose accordingly.

### [Complex Numbers from A to ... Z]()

#### deep theory & olympiad

*NT$2,129.62*

### [Complex Numbers Made Simple]()

#### intro textbook

*NT$966.78*

### [Intermediate Algebra Skills Practice Workbook with Answers: Functions, Radicals, Polynomials, Conics, Systems, Inequalities, and Complex Numbers]()

#### workbook practice mixed topics

*NT$364.83*

### [Complex Numbers (Practice/Problems)]()

#### pure complex‑numbers problem book

*NT$912.82*

### [Journey from Natural Numbers to Complex Numbers]()

#### bridge text natural→complex

*NT$778.26*

### [Introduction to Analysis with Complex Numbers]()

#### analysis level complex numbers

*NT$1,910.00*

### [ALGEBRA Math Practice Workbook]()

#### general algebra practice workbook

*NT$630.00*

### [Complex Numbers and Geometry]()

#### geometry oriented complex numbers

*NT$3,059.00*

Here’s a brief overview of each:

* [Complex Numbers from A to ... Z](): This is a very strong book by Titu Andreescu & Dorin Andrica. It goes deep, covering theory and many problems (including olympiad style) on complex numbers. Good if the student gets ahead and you want challenge questions. ([Goodreads][1])
* [Complex Numbers Made Simple](): A more accessible text that focuses just on complex numbers — great for reinforcing fundamentals.
* [Intermediate Algebra Skills Practice Workbook … and Complex Numbers](): A workbook with practice questions across several algebra topics (including complex numbers). Useful for timed drills and mixed-topic practice.
* [Complex Numbers (Practice/Problems)](): Focused purely on complex-numbers practice — good for targeted questions when your student needs “just complex numbers” sets.
* [Journey from Natural Numbers to Complex Numbers](): A book that shows how complex numbers build up from more basic number systems — helpful if your student needs a recap of why complex numbers work.
* [Introduction to Analysis with Complex Numbers](): A more advanced book (analysis of complex numbers) — maybe beyond what you need now but good if the student is interested and you want extension tasks.
* [ALGEBRA Math Practice Workbook](): A general algebra practice workbook which includes but is not limited to complex numbers. Great for overall speed building.
* [Complex Numbers and Geometry](): A book that links the algebra of complex numbers with geometry (complex plane, transformations). Good for extension or deeper understanding.

## 🎯 My Suggestion for You

Given your student is doing Grade 10 Algebra 2 (not necessarily a full university or olympiad curriculum), I’d pick a combination:

* Primary **practice book**: The workbook “Intermediate Algebra Skills Practice … Complex Numbers” (third item) + a pure complex numbers practice book (fourth item) for timed drills.
* Secondary **concept-reinforcement**: “Complex Numbers Made Simple” (second item) to ensure conceptual clarity.
* Optional **extension/challenge**: Use “Complex Numbers from A to … Z” (first item) or “Complex Numbers and Geometry” if the student goes faster and wants challenge problems.
* Use the general algebra practice workbook for mixed-topic timed sets (since in the test they won’t do *only* complex numbers).
* As the teacher, you can pick “Introduction to Analysis with Complex Numbers” for your reference, but you probably won’t assign it to the student (unless they show high aptitude).

---

## 📌 Additional Tips for Your Student

* Encourage them to **memorize** key forms quickly (e.g., (a+bi), how to divide complex numbers, conjugate form) so they don’t waste time deriving from scratch each time.
* Teach them time-saving techniques: e.g., factoring into conjugates quickly, recognition of roots of unity patterns, writing moduli quickly, etc.
* Emphasize checking: if an answer is of form (a + bi), make sure it’s simplified (e.g., no common factors, no unnatural form) — because slow or messy algebra costs time.
* Encourage “scan” of the full problem set at beginning of the timed drill: pick the ones you’re confident first, mark the harder ones for later.
* After each timed practice, do a **post-practice review**: what slowed me down? Could I have done that step faster/reused a known identity?

If you like, I can **pull together a ready-to-use “Complex Numbers” mini-quiz pack** (20 problems + timed 45 min sheet + solutions + error-analysis sheet) that matches your student’s level and the topics from Chapter 3 of Big Ideas Math. Would that be helpful?
