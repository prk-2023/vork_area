# AP CSP : Topics:


Topics covered in AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP), based on the *College Boardâ€™s official course 
and exam framework*.

## AP Computer Science Principles â€” Full Topic Breakdown

The course is structured around *5 Big Ideas*, each with *Learning Objectives and Essential Knowledge*.

---

### *Big Idea 1: Creative Development*

#### What You Learn:

* How to design and develop computer programs
* The iterative process of coding (plan â†’ write â†’ test â†’ improve)
* Collaboration in programming
* Writing pseudocode and explaining logic

#### Key Topics:

* Program development lifecycle (define, design, implement, test)
* Algorithms and problem-solving
* Documentation and debugging
* Code readability and clarity
* Pair programming & collaboration tools

---

### *Big Idea 2: Data*

#### What You Learn:

* How computers represent, store, and process data
* How data is collected, analyzed, visualized, and used

#### Key Topics:

* Binary representation of data (bits and bytes)
* Text, images, and numbers in binary
* Data compression (lossy vs. lossless)
* Data storage and file sizes
* Analyzing large data sets
* Visualizing trends (charts, graphs)
* Bias and ethical concerns in data use

---

### *Big Idea 3: Computing Systems and Networks*

#### What You Learn:

* How the internet works
* How devices communicate
* Cybersecurity basics

#### Key Topics:

* Structure of the internet (clients, servers, routers)
* IP addresses, DNS, and packet-switching
* Fault tolerance and redundancy
* Encryption and secure data transmission
* Phishing, malware, and cyber threats
* Protecting personal data

---

### *Big Idea 4: Algorithms and Programming*

#### What You Learn:

* The core programming skills (using any language, often Python, JavaScript, or block-based)
* Writing algorithms and controlling program flow

#### Key Topics:

* Variables and data types
* Arithmetic and logical operations
* Input and output
* Conditionals (`if`, `else`)
* Loops (e.g. `for`, `while`)
* Functions (parameters, return values)
* Lists/arrays and list operations (append, insert, access)
* Traversing lists
* Developing, testing, and refining programs
* Abstraction through procedures and functions

*This is the most programming-heavy part of CSP*

---

### *Big Idea 5: Impact of Computing*

#### What You Learn:

* Social, ethical, and legal implications of computing
* How technology affects society and the world

#### Key Topics:

* Positive and negative impacts of computing
* Digital divide and global access to technology
* Intellectual property, copyright, fair use
* Privacy and data ethics
* Responsible computing (accessibility, inclusivity)

## Performance Task (Create Task)

### What is it?

A **project that students design and build**, counting for **30% of the AP exam score**.

### Requirements:

* Create a program (using any language)
* Include:

  * **Input**
  * **A list**
  * **An algorithm (with sequencing, selection, iteration)**
* Submit:

  * Code
  * Written reflection (on development, function, algorithm, and data)
