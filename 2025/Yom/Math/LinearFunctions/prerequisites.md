*"Linear Functions: Parent Functions and Transformations"* for grade 9 through 12.

== *Prerequisites for Linear Functions: Parent Functions and Transformations*

=== 1. **Basic Algebra Skills**

* Understanding variables, constants, coefficients.
* Simplifying algebraic expressions.
* Basic operations with algebraic expressions (addition, subtraction, multiplication).

=== 2. **Coordinate Plane and Graphing**

* Knowledge of the Cartesian coordinate system (x-axis, y-axis, origin).
* Plotting points using ordered pairs $(x, y)$.
* Understanding the concept of a graph of a function.

=== 3. **Understanding Functions**

* Definition of a function as a relation where each input has exactly one output.
* Familiarity with function notation $f(x)$.
* Distinguishing between linear and nonlinear relationships.

=== 4. **Slope and Rate of Change**

* Concept of slope as “rise over run” or rate of change.
* Calculating slope from two points: $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$.
* Understanding positive, negative, zero, and undefined slopes.

=== 5. **Equation of a Line Basics**

* Understanding the slope-intercept form $y = mx + b$.
* Ability to identify slope $m$ and y-intercept $b$ from an equation.
* Plotting lines using slope and intercept.

=== 6. **Transformations (Basic Geometry)**

* Understanding translations (shifting graphs left/right, up/down).
* Basic concept of reflections across axes.
* Stretching and compressing shapes vertically and horizontally (introductory level).

=== 7. **Solving Linear Equations**

* Solving simple linear equations and inequalities.
* Rearranging equations to isolate variables.

If students are comfortable with these foundational skills, they will be well-prepared to tackle linear functions and their transformations effectively.

Would you like me to help create a **prerequisite review worksheet** or activities to reinforce these skills before starting the topic?
