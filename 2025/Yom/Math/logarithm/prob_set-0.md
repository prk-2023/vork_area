### Hints and Solution Strategy

* **For Problems 1, 4, 8, 9:** Use the properties of logarithms to simplify the given equations. For Problem 1, combine the logarithmic terms and convert the expression into a quadratic or polynomial form. For Problem 4, remember that for a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the sum of roots is $-b/a$ and the product of roots is $c/a$. For Problems 8 and 9, use the change of base formula and the power rule strategically.
* **For Problems 2, 5, 6, 7, 10:** The change of base formula, $log_b a = \frac{log_c a}{log_c b}$, is your best friend. For Problem 5, applying this formula will cause a cascading cancellation. For Problem 6, first simplify the arguments inside the logarithms. For Problem 10, convert all terms to a common base, such as base N.
* **For Problem 3:** Be extremely careful about the domain of the logarithmic function. The argument of the log must be positive, and the base must be positive and not equal to 1. This means you must satisfy multiple conditions: $x>0$, $x \neq 1$, $3-x>0$, and $x-1>0$. Combine these conditions to find the valid range for $x$ before solving the inequality.

**Note:** Attempt to solve these problems on your own before checking for solutions. The goal is to build problem-solving skills, which is the key to success in the JEE.
