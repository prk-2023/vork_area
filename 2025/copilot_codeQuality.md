Advice on which parts of AI are useful and which parts needs caution:

- The in-charge person should have the capabilities of understanding the repo well enough to modify the code
  that already exists and  also understand the repo well enough to consolidate similar  areas of code  that
  can be reused  and tested better if they were reused.

- For a new or junior developer to get the boss notice of their work is to show  they are incorporating the
  system that already in the repo as they are implementing the tickets, ideally  that they are  not re-using
  the code  but actually implementing  and iterating on the initial implementation of the code ( code that
  is suggested from AI) 

- Managers  having visceral understanding of why its bad to have the same code  duplicating  in multiple
  locations would find, that the AI code duplication ( which has increased as found in  the above research)
  is increasing over  time. 
  The ability to find duplicating blocks of code makes  humans unique that they have the ability to digest
  various methods that are similar to what you need and able to interpret which of those methods could
  actually be re-used slightly upgraded better documented and  tested and  use by multiple  systems,
  Demanding this from  a new developer or an nowise programmer  would be  a high and unfair. 

- Selecting and using AI tools for coding should be in a way to benefit from them and proving that you
  understand the  existing  code well enough to reuse and modify and iterate on it is the real
  differentiator for junior developer  that are trying to help their team write maintainable code
