# Stage 1: Foundation – Linux & C Programming Basics

---

### 1.1 Linux OS Basics

**Key Concepts:**

* **Linux architecture:** Kernel, shell, user space, system calls.
* **Filesystem hierarchy:** `/`, `/home`, `/etc`, `/proc`, `/sys`.
* **Permissions:** Read, write, execute for user/group/others.
* **Common commands:** `ls`, `cd`, `chmod`, `chown`, `cat`, `grep`, `ps`, `kill`.

---

### 1.2 Bash Scripting Basics

**Key Concepts:**

* Variables and environment variables
* Control structures: `if`, `for`, `while`
* Functions and script arguments
* Basic file operations in scripts

---

### 1.3 C Programming Fundamentals

**Key Concepts:**

* Data types, variables, operators
* Control structures: loops, conditionals
* Functions and header files
* Pointers and memory addresses
* Structures (`struct`) and typedef
* Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`)
* Bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, shift)
* File I/O basics with `fopen`, `fread`, `fwrite`, `fclose`

---

### 1.4 Tools

* **Compiler:** `gcc` basics — compiling, linking, flags
* **Makefiles:** Writing simple `Makefile` to automate builds
* **Debugging:** Using `gdb` for simple C programs
* **Other:** `valgrind` for memory debugging, `strace` for system call tracing

### Hands-on Exercises

1. Write a simple C program that prints "Hello, World!".
2. Create a bash script that reads a filename from user input and prints its contents.
3. Write a C program using pointers to swap two integers.
4. Use `gcc` to compile a program with debugging symbols, and debug with `gdb`.
5. Write a bash script with a loop that lists all `.txt` files in a directory.
