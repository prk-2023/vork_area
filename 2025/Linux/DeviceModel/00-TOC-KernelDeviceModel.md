# Linux Device Model:

Learning about Device model is the key to mastering Linux Kernel development, embedded systems and device driver programming.

## Linux Device Model Learning Roadmap
A structured Roadmap to help you build solid understanding, progressing from the basics to writing your own drivers that interact with the Linux device model.

1. Foundation - Linux and C programming Basics:

### Stage 1: Foundation – Linux & C Programming Basics

#### Objectives:

* Understand Linux OS architecture
* Master C programming (especially for kernel-level code)
* Be comfortable working in the terminal

#### Topics:

* Linux command line, file system, permissions
* Bash scripting (for automation)
* C basics: pointers, structures, bit manipulation, memory management
* GCC, `make`, `gdb`, `strace`, `objdump`

#### Tools:

* Ubuntu/Debian or Arch (or any kernel-source-friendly distro)
* Text editor (Vim, VS Code, etc.)
* QEMU (for safe kernel testing)

#### Goal:

> Be able to write and compile basic C programs and navigate Linux confidently.

---

### Stage 2: Linux Kernel Basics

#### Objectives:

* Understand the Linux kernel structure and build process
* Learn about kernel modules and the kernel build system

#### Topics:

* Kernel layout (`init`, `drivers`, `fs`, `mm`, etc.)
* Kernel configuration and compilation
* Loadable Kernel Modules (LKMs)
* Kernel logs: `dmesg`, `printk`
* Kernel headers and symbols

#### Hands-on:

* Download and build a vanilla kernel
* Write and insert a simple "Hello, kernel!" module

#### Goal:

> Understand how the kernel is built and how modules integrate with it.

---

### Stage 3: Intro to Linux Device Model

#### Objectives:

* Learn the theory behind the device model
* Understand the relationship between **devices**, **drivers**, **buses**, and **classes**

#### Topics:

* `struct device`
* `struct device_driver`
* `struct bus_type`
* `struct class`
* `sysfs` and `/sys` layout
* uevents and hotplug mechanism

#### Hands-on:

* Explore `/sys/class/`, `/sys/bus/`, `/sys/devices/`
* Write a kernel module that registers a device and exposes attributes in sysfs

#### Goal:

> Understand how the kernel represents and manages hardware.

---

### Stage 4: Writing and Binding Drivers

#### Objectives:

* Learn to write actual drivers using the Linux device model
* Understand how the kernel matches devices to drivers

#### Topics:

* Driver registration (`driver_register`, `device_register`)
* Driver probe/remove methods
* Module aliases and device ID matching
* Writing `bus_type` handlers (for custom buses)
* Using `container_of()` macro

#### Hands-on:

* Write a basic platform driver (`platform_driver`, `platform_device`)
* Log probing, removing, and matching via `dmesg`
* Explore `/sys/class/` and `/dev` interactions

#### Goal:

> Be able to create and bind a simple driver to a device in kernel space.

---

### Stage 5: Advanced Device Model Topics

#### Objectives:

* Learn how device model interacts with other kernel subsystems

#### Topics:

* Power management (`suspend`, `resume`)
* Device Tree and ACPI
* Hotplug & coldplug events
* Integration with `udev`
* Creating `struct class` and dynamic device nodes
* sysfs attributes (`device_create_file`, `DEVICE_ATTR`)

#### Hands-on:

* Simulate hotplugging using `modprobe`, `udevadm`
* Create a custom class and expose a device under `/sys/class`
* Work with `udev` rules to create `/dev` nodes

#### Goal:

> Understand the full lifecycle of a device in the Linux system.

### Stage 5.1: Advanced Linux Device Model Topics

#### Stage 5.1: Advanced Linux Device Model Topics

---

### What this stage covers:

* **Power management in-depth:** runtime PM, system suspend, wakeup handling
* **Device driver model internals:** device and driver structs deep dive
* **Advanced sysfs and kobject manipulation**
* **Reference counting and lifetime management**
* **Dynamic device creation/removal and hotplugging mechanisms**
* **Multi-function devices and function drivers**
* **Device model locking and concurrency**
* **Using debugfs and tracing tools to troubleshoot device model issues**

---

### 6.1 Power Management (PM)

* **Runtime PM:** Allows devices to suspend/resume individually when idle.
* **System PM:** Suspend/resume entire system; devices coordinate through PM callbacks.
* Implemented via `.runtime_suspend()`, `.runtime_resume()`, `.suspend()`, `.resume()` callbacks in the driver.
* Use `pm_runtime_enable()`, `pm_runtime_get_sync()`, `pm_runtime_put()` APIs for runtime PM.

---

### 6.2 Device and Driver Struct Internals

* Understanding `struct device`, `struct device_driver`, `struct bus_type`.
* Their fields, especially kobjects, reference counts, and power management data.
* How these structs link together to implement device model functionality.

---

### 6.3 Advanced Sysfs & Kobject Usage

* Creating nested sysfs groups and attributes.
* Custom kobjects vs device kobjects.
* Adding/removing sysfs attributes dynamically.

---

### 6.4 Reference Counting & Lifetime

* `get_device()`, `put_device()`, `kobject_get()`, `kobject_put()`.
* Avoiding memory leaks and use-after-free bugs.
* Proper device and driver ownership management.

---

### 6.5 Dynamic Device Creation & Hotplugging

* Using `device_register()`, `device_add()`, `device_unregister()`.
* Hotplug events and uevent emission.
* Creating devices for hardware discovered at runtime.

---

### 6.6 Multi-function Devices

* Devices exposing multiple interfaces/functions.
* How device model manages multiple function drivers for a single physical device.

---

### 6.7 Device Model Locking and Concurrency

* Spinlocks, mutexes protecting device model structures.
* When and how to use locking in device drivers.

---

### 6.8 Debugging Device Model

* Using `debugfs` entries like `/sys/kernel/debug/devices`.
* `udevadm monitor`, `udevadm info` for runtime device info.
* Kernel dynamic debug, tracepoints, and ftrace for tracing device events.

---

### How do you want to proceed?

* **Deep dive into runtime PM with a sample driver?**
* **Explore multi-function devices with example?**
* **Walkthrough of reference counting and safe device removal?**
* **Example of advanced sysfs attribute management?**
* **Showcase debugging device model with debugfs and tracing?**

Pick whichever sounds most useful or ask for something else!
------------------------------------------
### Stage 6: Real-World Projects & Debugging

#### Objectives:

* Gain practical experience with real devices
* Learn debugging and troubleshooting techniques

#### Topics:

* Debugging with `dmesg`, `ftrace`, `debugfs`
* Using `gdb` with QEMU or real hardware
* Working with GPIO, I2C, SPI using the device model
* Writing device drivers for real sensors or virtual devices

#### Hands-on Projects:

* Write a Linux driver for a GPIO button or LED
* Create a virtual device driver for testing
* Contribute to an open-source driver or patch

#### Goal:

> Be able to build, debug, and maintain Linux drivers using the device model.
