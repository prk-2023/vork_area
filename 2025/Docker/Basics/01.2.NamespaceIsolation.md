# Namespace Isolation:


### 1. **What is a Namespace?**

A **namespace** in Linux is a feature that isolates and virtualize's system resources for processes, 
allowing different processes to have their own view of the system, as if they are running on separate 
machines. 

Each namespace provides an abstraction that limits the visibility of certain resources such as process IDs,
file systems, networking, and more. 

This isolation is crucial for containers, allowing each container to have its own isolated environment on 
the same host.

Namespaces enable:

- Isolation of resources like network interfaces, process IDs, and mount points.

- A process can be assigned to one or more namespaces, allowing it to have a different view of the system.

- Multiple processes (e.g., in different containers) can operate independently of each other on the same 
  physical host.

There are several types of namespaces in Linux:

1. **PID namespace**: 
    Isolates process IDs. Processes in different PID namespaces have independent process ID trees.

2. **Mount namespace**: 
    Isolates file system mount points. Processes can have different views of the filesystem.

3. **Network namespace**: 
    Isolates network devices, IP addr's, routing tables, and ports. 
    Each network namespace can have its own interfaces and routes.

4. **IPC namespace**: 
    Isolates IPC resources such as message queues, semaphores, and shared memory.

5. **UTS namespace**: 
    Isolates hostname and domain name. Each namespace can have its own hostname.

6. **User namespace**: 
    Isolates user and group IDs. This allows processes to have different views of the user and group IDs.

7. **Cgroup namespace**: 
    Isolates control groups (cgroups), enabling processes in different namespaces to have separate resource 
    limits.

8. **Time namespace** (introduced in Linux 5.6): Allows different processes to have separate views of the 
   system time.

### 2. **Namespace Supportin the Linux Kernel?**

Namespaces are implemented in the Linux kernel as a set of virtualized, isolated resources that processes 
can belong to. 

The kernel ensures that processes within the same namespace see the same virtualized resources, while 
processes in different namespaces see different resources.

#### Key Components:
- **Namespace Control Groups**: 
  Each namespace is a **control group** (cgroup) that manages resources allocated to processes. 
  The kernel manages these namespaces and ensures that processes cannot see resources in other namespaces.

- **Namespace Management**: 
  The kernel provides functions to create, destroy, and join namespaces. 
  The `clone()` system call is one of the primary ways a new process can be created in a specific namespace.

- **Process Structure**: 
  Each process has a `struct task_struct` that holds references to the namespaces it belongs to. 
  The kernel uses these references to check which namespace a process is in and determine which system 
  resources it can access.

#### Kernel Files Involved in Namespace Support:
Namespaces are primarily implemented in the following parts of the Linux kernel source code:

1. **`kernel/nsproxy.c`**: This file contains code for managing the namespaces themselves. 
   It handles the creation, copying, and destruction of namespaces.

2. **`include/linux/nsproxy.h`**: Defines structures related to namespaces, such as `struct nsproxy`, 
   which holds references to the namespaces a process is using.

3. **`kernel/fork.c`**: The `clone()` system call, which is used to create processes in new namespaces, is 
   implemented here. 
   The `clone()` call supports flags that specify which namespaces a new process should be placed into.

4. **`arch/`**: architecture-specific code for managing namespaces may also reside in the arch-specific 
   directories (e.g., `arch/x86/`), which include low-level implementations for process creation 
   and resource management.

5. **`kernel/utsname.c`**: Handles the UTS namespace, which allows processes to have their own hostname.

6. **`net/`**: The networking namespace, located in the `net/` directory, is crucial for managing network 
   isolation. 
   This code handles network interfaces, IP addresses, and routing tables within network namespaces.

7. **`fs/`**: The mount namespace is implemented in the `fs/` directory. 
    It handles the creation and management of different mount points for processes in different namespaces.

### 3. **How is Namespace Used in Containers?**


Namespaces are the foundation of process isolation in **Linux containers**. 
Containers rely on namespaces to provide an isolated environment for running applications. 
Each container is typically created with its own set of namespaces, meaning it has its own isolated view 
of system resources, including:

- **PID namespace**: 
  Containers can have their own process IDs, so processes inside the container won't conflict with those 
  running on the host or in other containers.

- **Network namespace**: 
  Each container can have its own network stack, including virtual network interfaces, IP addresses, 
  and routing tables, ensuring complete isolation between containersâ€™ networking.

- **Mount namespace**: 
  Containers can mount file systems independently from the host system, making the root filesystem of each 
  container appear isolated from the others.

- **IPC namespace**: 
  Containers can have their own inter-process communication resources, like message queues and shared mem.

- **UTS namespace**: 
  Containers can set their own hostname and domain name, making them appear as independent systems.

- **User namespace**: 
  This enables the container to have its own user and group IDs, allowing users in the container to have 
  different privileges from those on the host.

- **Cgroup namespace**: 
  Containers can be assigned their own cgroups for controlling resource usage like CPU and memory, 
  independent of other containers or the host.

#### Containerization Technologies:
- **Docker**: Docker uses Linux namespaces to create containers. 
  When you run a container in Docker, it uses the `--privileged` flag (or other options) to configure the 
  container with a set of namespaces. 
  Docker uses Linux namespaces to isolate containers from each other and the host.

- **Kubernetes**: 
  Kubernetes uses namespaces in conjunction with cgroups, providing containers with resource isolation and 
  ensuring that they are scheduled properly on nodes. 
  Kubernetes itself also relies on namespaces for resource isolation at the cluster level.

### 4. **How to Use Namespaces in Code (Creating a New Namespace)**

To create a new namespace for a process, the `clone()` system call is used, which allows the creation of 
new processes with specific namespaces. For example, to create a new process in a different namespace, 
you can use:

```c
#include <sched.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define STACK_SIZE 1024*1024

static char child_stack[STACK_SIZE];

int child_fn(void *arg) {
    printf("Child process in new PID namespace\n");
    return 0;
}

int main() {
    pid_t pid = clone(child_fn, child_stack + STACK_SIZE, CLONE_NEWPID | SIGCHLD, NULL);
    if (pid == -1) {
        perror("clone");
        exit(1);
    }

    printf("Parent process\n");
    waitpid(pid, NULL, 0);
    return 0;
}
```

In this example:
- The `CLONE_NEWPID` flag creates a new PID namespace for the child process.
- The `child_fn` function will be executed by the child process, which runs in the new namespace.

The `clone()` system call, when used with appropriate flags, is how processes are assigned to specific 
namespaces. 

The kernel manages the mapping between processes and namespaces through the `nsproxy` structure, 
ensuring that each process has the correct namespace view.

### Summary:

- **Namespaces** provide isolation for processes by virtualizing system resources 
  (e.g., process IDs, network stack, mount points, etc.) to give each process or container its own 
  independent view of the system.

- **Kernel Source**: Namespace support is implemented primarily in files such as 
  `kernel/nsproxy.c`, 
  `kernel/fork.c`, 
  `fs/`, and 
  `net/`, 
  depending on the type of namespace (e.g., PID, Network, Mount).

- **Containers** use namespaces to ensure that processes inside containers are isolated from each other and 
  from the host system, enabling the creation of lightweight, secure, and resource-efficient environments.
