# Namespace Isolation:


### 1. **What is a Namespace?**

A **namespace** in Linux is a feature that isolates and virtualize's system resources for processes, 
allowing different processes to have their own view of the system, as if they are running on separate 
machines. 

Each namespace provides an abstraction that limits the visibility of certain resources such as process IDs,
file systems, networking, and more. 

This isolation is crucial for containers, allowing each container to have its own isolated environment on 
the same host.

Namespaces enable:

- Isolation of resources like network interfaces, process IDs, and mount points.

- A process can be assigned to one or more namespaces, allowing it to have a different view of the system.

- Multiple processes (e.g., in different containers) can operate independently of each other on the same 
  physical host.

There are several types of namespaces in Linux:

1. **PID namespace**: 
    Isolates process IDs. Processes in different PID namespaces have independent process ID trees.

2. **Mount namespace**: 
    Isolates file system mount points. Processes can have different views of the filesystem.

3. **Network namespace**: 
    Isolates network devices, IP addr's, routing tables, and ports. 
    Each network namespace can have its own interfaces and routes.

4. **IPC namespace**: 
    Isolates IPC resources such as message queues, semaphores, and shared memory.

5. **UTS namespace**: 
    Isolates hostname and domain name. Each namespace can have its own hostname.

6. **User namespace**: 
    Isolates user and group IDs. This allows processes to have different views of the user and group IDs.

7. **Cgroup namespace**: 
    Isolates control groups (cgroups), enabling processes in different namespaces to have separate resource 
    limits.

8. **Time namespace** (introduced in Linux 5.6): Allows different processes to have separate views of the 
   system time.

### 2. **Namespace Supportin the Linux Kernel?**

Namespaces are implemented in the Linux kernel as a set of virtualized, isolated resources that processes 
can belong to. 

The kernel ensures that processes within the same namespace see the same virtualized resources, while 
processes in different namespaces see different resources.

#### Key Components:
- **Namespace Control Groups**: 
  Each namespace is a **control group** (cgroup) that manages resources allocated to processes. 
  The kernel manages these namespaces and ensures that processes cannot see resources in other namespaces.

- **Namespace Management**: 
  The kernel provides functions to create, destroy, and join namespaces. 
  The `clone()` system call is one of the primary ways a new process can be created in a specific namespace.

- **Process Structure**: 
  Each process has a `struct task_struct` that holds references to the namespaces it belongs to. 
  The kernel uses these references to check which namespace a process is in and determine which system 
  resources it can access.

#### Kernel Files Involved in Namespace Support:
Namespaces are primarily implemented in the following parts of the Linux kernel source code:

1. **`kernel/nsproxy.c`**: This file contains code for managing the namespaces themselves. 
   It handles the creation, copying, and destruction of namespaces.

2. **`include/linux/nsproxy.h`**: Defines structures related to namespaces, such as `struct nsproxy`, 
   which holds references to the namespaces a process is using.

3. **`kernel/fork.c`**: The `clone()` system call, which is used to create processes in new namespaces, is 
   implemented here. 
   The `clone()` call supports flags that specify which namespaces a new process should be placed into.

4. **`arch/`**: architecture-specific code for managing namespaces may also reside in the arch-specific 
   directories (e.g., `arch/x86/`), which include low-level implementations for process creation 
   and resource management.

5. **`kernel/utsname.c`**: Handles the UTS namespace, which allows processes to have their own hostname.

6. **`net/`**: The networking namespace, located in the `net/` directory, is crucial for managing network 
   isolation. 
   This code handles network interfaces, IP addresses, and routing tables within network namespaces.

7. **`fs/`**: The mount namespace is implemented in the `fs/` directory. 
    It handles the creation and management of different mount points for processes in different namespaces.

### 3. **How is Namespace Used in Containers?**


Namespaces are the foundation of process isolation in **Linux containers**. 
Containers rely on namespaces to provide an isolated environment for running applications. 
Each container is typically created with its own set of namespaces, meaning it has its own isolated view 
of system resources, including:

- **PID namespace**: 
  Containers can have their own process IDs, so processes inside the container won't conflict with those 
  running on the host or in other containers.

- **Network namespace**: 
  Each container can have its own network stack, including virtual network interfaces, IP addresses, 
  and routing tables, ensuring complete isolation between containers’ networking.

- **Mount namespace**: 
  Containers can mount file systems independently from the host system, making the root filesystem of each 
  container appear isolated from the others.

- **IPC namespace**: 
  Containers can have their own inter-process communication resources, like message queues and shared mem.

- **UTS namespace**: 
  Containers can set their own hostname and domain name, making them appear as independent systems.

- **User namespace**: 
  This enables the container to have its own user and group IDs, allowing users in the container to have 
  different privileges from those on the host.

- **Cgroup namespace**: 
  Containers can be assigned their own cgroups for controlling resource usage like CPU and memory, 
  independent of other containers or the host.

#### Containerization Technologies:
- **Docker**: Docker uses Linux namespaces to create containers. 
  When you run a container in Docker, it uses the `--privileged` flag (or other options) to configure the 
  container with a set of namespaces. 
  Docker uses Linux namespaces to isolate containers from each other and the host.

- **Kubernetes**: 
  Kubernetes uses namespaces in conjunction with cgroups, providing containers with resource isolation and 
  ensuring that they are scheduled properly on nodes. 
  Kubernetes itself also relies on namespaces for resource isolation at the cluster level.

### 4. **How to Use Namespaces in Code (Creating a New Namespace)**

To create a new namespace for a process, the `clone()` system call is used, which allows the creation of 
new processes with specific namespaces. For example, to create a new process in a different namespace, 
you can use:

```c
#include <sched.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define STACK_SIZE 1024*1024

static char child_stack[STACK_SIZE];

int child_fn(void *arg) {
    printf("Child process in new PID namespace\n");
    return 0;
}

int main() {
    pid_t pid = clone(child_fn, child_stack + STACK_SIZE, CLONE_NEWPID | SIGCHLD, NULL);
    if (pid == -1) {
        perror("clone");
        exit(1);
    }

    printf("Parent process\n");
    waitpid(pid, NULL, 0);
    return 0;
}
```
Updated version of the above code:
```C 
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <sched.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define STACK_SIZE 1024*1024

static char child_stack[STACK_SIZE];

int child_fn(void *arg) {
    // In a new PID namespace, this will print 1
    printf("Child: My PID inside the namespace is %d\n", getpid());
    return 0;
}

int main() {
    printf("Parent: My PID is %d\n", getpid());

    // CLONE_NEWPID creates the process in a new PID hierarchy
    pid_t pid = clone(child_fn, child_stack + STACK_SIZE, CLONE_NEWPID | SIGCHLD, NULL);
    
    if (pid == -1) {
        perror("clone");
        exit(1);
    }

    printf("Parent: I see the child as PID %d\n", pid);
    
    waitpid(pid, NULL, 0);
    printf("Parent: Child has finished.\n");
    return 0;
}
```
```bash 
$ gcc pid_ns.c -o pid_ns
$ sudo ./pid_ns 
Parent: My PID is 6853
Child: My PID inside the namespace is 1
Parent: I see the child as PID 6854
Parent: Child has finished.
```
In Linux, PID 1 is reserved for the init process (like systemd). 
By making the child PID 1 inside its own namespace, you are effectively telling that process it is the 
"ancestor" of its own private world. 
If this child were to spawn its own children, they would see this process as their parent, completely 
unaware of the main operating system running outside.

Exercise: refer to "./src/pid_proc_ns.c" 
    The program mounts its own `/proc` fs, so that the command like `top` and `ps` only show the child's
    processes.

In this example:
- The `CLONE_NEWPID` flag creates a new PID namespace for the child process.
- The `child_fn` function will be executed by the child process, which runs in the new namespace.

The `clone()` system call, when used with appropriate flags, is how processes are assigned to specific 
namespaces. 

The kernel manages the mapping between processes and namespaces through the `nsproxy` structure, 
ensuring that each process has the correct namespace view.

### Summary:

- **Namespaces** provide isolation for processes by virtualizing system resources 
  (e.g., process IDs, network stack, mount points, etc.) to give each process or container its own 
  independent view of the system.

- **Kernel Source**: Namespace support is implemented primarily in files such as 
  `kernel/nsproxy.c`, 
  `kernel/fork.c`, 
  `fs/`, and 
  `net/`, 
  depending on the type of namespace (e.g., PID, Network, Mount).

- **Containers** use namespaces to ensure that processes inside containers are isolated from each other and 
  from the host system, enabling the creation of lightweight, secure, and resource-efficient environments.

 # How is the isolation supported:

In Linux, the **global resources** that are isolated using namespaces are crucial to understand how 
containerization and process isolation work. 

These global resources can be found in various parts of the Linux kernel source code. 
Below is a list of the primary global resources related to namespaces and where location for  reference:

### **Global Resources and Kernel Code Locations**

1. **Process IDs (PID)**
   - **Resource**: The PID (Process ID) is used to identify processes across the system.
   - **Namespace**: PID Namespace
   - **Kernel Code Reference**: core handling of process IDs is in `kernel/pid.c` & `include/linux/pid.h`. 
     The functions for creating and managing PID namespaces are in `kernel/nsproxy.c` and `kernel/fork.c`.

2. **User and Group IDs (UID/GID)**
   - **Resource**: UID and GID are used to control user and group permissions across the system.
   - **Namespace**: User Namespace
   - **Kernel Code Reference**: User namespace management can be found in `kernel/user_namespace.c` and 
    `include/linux/user_namespace.h`. UID/GID mappings and related functionality are part of this code.

3. **File System Mounts**
   - **Resource**: The file system, including directories, mount points, and the virtual file system (VFS).
   - **Namespace**: Mount Namespace
   - **Kernel Code Reference**: Mounting and unmounting operations are handled in `fs/namespace.c`, 
    `fs/mount.c`, and `include/linux/mount.h`. The core logic for mounting namespaces is in `fs/namespace.c`.

4. **Network Interfaces**
   - **Resource**: Network stack, including interfaces (eth0, lo), IP addresses, routing tables, and 
     network configurations.
   - **Namespace**: Network Namespace
   - **Kernel Code Reference**: Network namespace code is located in `net/core/net_namespace.c` and 
    `include/linux/net_namespace.h`. The setup and isolation of network resources are handled here.

5. **Inter-process Communication (IPC)**
   - **Resource**: IPC resources such as message queues, semaphores, and shared memory.
   - **Namespace**: IPC Namespace
   - **Kernel Code Reference**: IPC namespace isolation can be found in `kernel/ipc/namespace.c`, and the 
     main code for managing IPC resources in `ipc/util.c`, `ipc/msg.c`, and `ipc/sem.c`.

6. **Control Groups (Cgroups)**
   - **Resource**: Cgroups are used to organize processes and control resource usage (CPU, memory, disk, etc.).
   - **Namespace**: Cgroup Namespace
   - **Kernel Code Reference**: Cgroup functionality is primarily implemented in `kernel/cgroup.c` and 
     `include/linux/cgroup.h`. 
     The cgroup namespace handling code can be found in `kernel/cgroup/cgroup_namespace.c`.

7. **Hostnames and Domain Names**
   - **Resource**: System hostname and domain name, which are used to identify the machine on the network.
   - **Namespace**: UTS Namespace (Unix Timesharing System)
   - **Kernel Code Reference**: Hostname isolation is implemented in `kernel/utsname.c` and 
     `include/linux/utsname.h`. 
     The `uts_namespace` structures are used here to manage hostname and domain name isolation.

8. **Timers**
   - **Resource**: System-wide timers and timer queues.
   - **Namespace**: Timer Namespace (not directly a separate namespace, but important for time-related isolation)
   - **Kernel Code Reference**: Time management code, including timers, is found in `kernel/time/time.c` 
     and `include/linux/timer.h`. 
     However, timer isolation is often handled indirectly through process scheduling and timekeeping code.

9. **Namespaces (General)**
   - **Resource**: All namespaces themselves are abstract structures that encapsulate the different resources 
     mentioned above.
   - **Namespace**: All types of namespaces (PID, User, Network, etc.)
   - **Kernel Code Reference**: General namespace handling is in `kernel/nsproxy.c`, `kernel/fork.c`, and 
     `include/linux/nsproxy.h`. 
     Functions like `copy_process()` in `kernel/fork.c` handle the process of cloning a new namespace for processes.

### **Key Structures for Namespace Isolation**

- **`struct pid_namespace`**: This structure represents the PID namespace. (include/linux/pid_namespace.h).

- **`struct user_namespace`**: This structure represents the user namespace.(include/linux/user_namespace.h).

- **`struct mount` and `struct fs_namespace`**: These structures are related to the mount namespace and 
  represent mounted file systems and file system isolation. Defined in `include/linux/fs.h` & `fs/namespace.c`.

- **`struct net_namespace`**: Represents a network namespace, defining network isolation. 
    (`include/linux/net_namespace.h`).

- **`struct ipc_namespace`**: This structure represents the IPC namespace, used for isolating IPC resources 
  like shared memory and semaphores. Defined in `include/linux/ipc_namespace.h`.

- **`struct uts_namespace`**: This structure represents the UTS namespace, for isolating hostname and 
  domain name. Defined in `include/linux/utsname.h`.

- **`struct cgroup_namespace`**: Represents the cgroup namespace and manages resource limits for processes. 
  Defined in `include/linux/cgroup.h`.

### **Namespace Code Interaction**

- **Namespace Creation**: Code for creating new namespaces is primarily located in `kernel/fork.c`, where 
  the `clone()` system call is responsible for creating new processes within a specific namespace.

- **Namespace Cloning**: Functions like `copy_process()` and `do_fork()` in `kernel/fork.c` handle the 
  logic for creating a new process in a new namespace.

- **Namespace Linking**: The kernel maintains namespace links in process control structures. 
  The `task_struct` (defined in `include/linux/sched.h`) contains pointers to namespaces that are associated
  with the process.

- **Namespace Management**: Functions for switching, entering, and managing namespaces are implemented in 
  `kernel/nsproxy.c`. The `nsproxy` structure encapsulates pointers to the various namespaces 
  (PID, user, mount, network, etc.).

### **How to Understand Namespace Isolation in Kernel Code**

1. **Look for Namespace Initialization and Cloning**: The kernel code in `fork.c` and `nsproxy.c` is key to 
   understanding how namespaces are created, initialized, and cloned during process creation. 
   This is central to how containers are isolated from the host system.
   
2. **Understand the `task_struct`**: This structure holds information about the process, including pointers 
   to the namespaces it belongs to. Investigate the `task_struct` in `include/linux/sched.h` to see how 
   namespaces are linked with processes.

3. **Trace Kernel Functions Involving Namespaces**: Functions such as `clone()`, `setns()`, and others 
   related to process creation and management are heavily involved with namespaces. 
   You can track these functions in `kernel/fork.c` to understand how namespaces are applied to new processes.


4. **Check the Namespace Files in `/proc`**: 
    The `/proc` filesystem exposes information about processes, and you can view how namespaces are applied 
    to running processes. Kernel source code that interacts with `/proc` is in `fs/proc/`.

### **Summary**

To summarize, the **global resources** in Linux that are isolated by namespaces include **PID**, **UID/GID**,
**filesystem mounts**, **network configurations**, **IPC**, **cgroups**, **hostnames**, and **timers**. 

These resources are isolated by the kernel through various namespaces such as PID, user, mount, network, and 
others. 

You can explore the kernel code in files like `kernel/pid.c`, `fs/namespace.c`, `net/core/net_namespace.c`,
`kernel/user_namespace.c`, and others mentioned above to understand how these resources are managed and 
isolated. 
By studying these files, you'll gain insight into the inner workings of Linux namespaces and how they 
enable containerization.

# pid and pid_namespace

When a process is associated with a **PID (Process ID)** in Linux, the kernel uses this PID to manage and 
track the process within the system. 

The process ID is crucial for identifying and interacting with processes in the kernel. 
It’s tied to the **process control block (PCB)** of each process and plays a central role in scheduling, 
resource management, and process management.

What happens from the kernel’s point of view when a process is associated with a PID, focusing on the 
**`pid`** and **`pid_namespace`** structures.

### 1. **PID Structure (`struct pid`)**

The **PID** in the Linux kernel is represented by the **`struct pid`**, defined at `include/linux/pid.h`. 
The `struct pid` is used to uniquely identify a process in a particular PID namespace.

#### Key Elements of `struct pid`:

- **`nr`**: The PID number within the specific PID namespace.

- **`level`**: The level of the PID namespace (for nested namespaces). 
  This helps identify if the PID belongs to a root or child PID namespace.

- **`namespace`**: A pointer to the `pid_namespace` structure that this PID belongs to.

- **`tasks`**: A list of tasks (processes) associated with this PID, linked through a list structure for 
  process scheduling and task management.

- **`count`**: A reference count that tracks the number of active references to the `struct pid`, ensuring 
  it is properly cleaned up when no longer needed.

#### Kernel Action:

When a process is created, the kernel allocates a `struct pid` to it. 
This PID structure is associated with the process through the **`task_struct`** structure, which holds all 
the information about a running process. Each process will have its own `task_struct`, and the **PID** is 
just one of the many attributes of this structure.

In the kernel, processes are tracked by their **task_struct**, which has a `pid` field pointing to the 
relevant `struct pid` that uniquely identifies the process in the corresponding **PID namespace**.

### 2. **PID Namespace (`struct pid_namespace`)**

A **PID namespace** is a collection of PIDs for processes in a specific context. 
The kernel supports multiple PID namespaces, which allow process IDs to be reused across different namespaces.

#### Key Elements of `struct pid_namespace`:

- **`level`**: The "depth" of the PID namespace, with the root namespace being at level 0. 
  This field is crucial for the hierarchical structure of PID namespaces.

- **`parent`**: A pointer to the parent PID namespace, forming a tree of PID namespaces.

- **`pid_hash`**: A hash table for managing PID mappings within the namespace.

- **`last_pid`**: Keeps track of the last assigned PID in this namespace to ensure uniqueness within the 
  namespace.

- **`pid_lock`**: A lock used to synchronize PID allocation across processes in the same namespace.

#### Kernel Action:

When a process is created, the kernel assigns it a **PID** in the context of the PID namespace it belongs to.
The kernel handles **PID namespaces** as follows:

- **Creating a PID in a Namespace**: 
    The kernel allocates a PID for the process by calling `alloc_pid()` in the PID namespace. 
    The function ensures that the PID is unique within that namespace by checking the available space 
    in the hash table (`pid_hash`) and incrementing the `last_pid` counter.

- **PID Reuse and Namespace Hierarchy**: 
    In a nested PID namespace, a process in a child namespace can have the same PID as a process in the 
    parent namespace. 
    For example, a process in a container might have PID 1 in its PID namespace, even though the same 
    PID number might be used for a different process on the host system.

- **PID Mappings**: 
    The kernel uses mappings between PIDs in the parent and child PID namespaces. 
    The parent namespace is responsible for allocating global PIDs, while child namespaces can use their 
    own local PIDs. 
    The kernel keeps track of this relationship to ensure proper management of process interactions between 
    namespaces.

### 3. **Process Creation and PID Assignment**

When a new process is created (via `fork()`, `clone()`, or `exec()`), kernel performs the following actions:

- **Process ID Assignment**: 
  The kernel allocates a new `struct pid` using the appropriate **PID namespace**. 
  It assigns a unique PID number to the new process within that namespace.

- **Process Control Block (`task_struct`) Creation**: 
  A new **`task_struct`** is created for the process, and it includes a reference to the allocated 
  `struct pid`. 
  The `task_struct` contains all information about the process, including its PID, parent PID (PPID), 
  resource usage, and more.

- **Task Struct Linkage**: 
  The newly created `task_struct` is linked into the kernel's scheduler and process management system. 
  The kernel uses the PID (via `struct pid`) to track and manage the task. 
  The task can now be scheduled and will interact with other processes based on its PID.

- **PID Namespace Linking**: 
    The `task_struct` also contains a pointer to the `pid_namespace` in which the process resides. 
    The kernel uses this pointer to determine which namespace the PID belongs to, ensuring that processes 
    in different namespaces are isolated from each other.

### 4. **PID Namespace Hierarchy**

Linux supports a hierarchical structure of namespaces, meaning that **child namespaces** can inherit 
processes from **parent namespaces**, but with isolated PIDs. The kernel manages this hierarchy as follows:

- **Root PID Namespace**: The root PID namespace is where the system's global PIDs are managed. 
The first processes created on the system (e.g., `init` or `systemd`) reside in this namespace.

- **Child PID Namespaces**: When containers or other isolated environments are created, a new child PID 
  namespace is instantiated. This allows processes in the container to have their own set of PIDs, starting 
  from 1. 
  The kernel ensures that processes in the child namespace have PIDs that are unique within that namespace, 
  while still maintaining a mapping to global PIDs.
  
  In the case of container runtimes like Docker or Podman, each container may run with its own PID namespace,
  making the processes in the container appear as though they are independent from the host system, even 
  though they share the same kernel.

### 5. **Managing PID Transitions Between Namespaces**

When a process moves between PID namespaces (e.g., a process from a parent PID namespace joining a child 
namespace), the kernel performs a **namespace transition**. This typically happens when using the `setns()`
system call, which allows processes to join existing namespaces.

- **Transition Handling**: During such a transition, the kernel ensures the process is correctly mapped to 
  the PID namespace it is joining. 
  It modifies the PID reference in the `task_struct` to point to the new `struct pid` for the target 
  namespace.
  
### 6. **Example of Process Creation and PID Assignment**

Let’s consider a basic example of creating a process inside a container (which uses a new PID namespace):

1. The container runtime (e.g., Docker, Podman) invokes the `clone()` system call to create a new process 
   in the container.
2. The kernel allocates a new `struct pid` in the container's PID namespace.
3. The kernel assigns the process a PID (e.g., PID 1 inside the container) in the new PID namespace.
4. The `task_struct` for the new process is created, with a reference to the newly allocated `struct pid`.
5. The kernel schedules the process to run and tracks it based on its PID in the container's namespace.

On the host system, this process will be assigned a different PID in the global PID namespace 
(e.g., PID 1234), but from the container's perspective, it appears as PID 1.

### **Summary**

To summarize, when a process is associated with a PID in Linux:

- The kernel allocates a **`struct pid`** for the process, which is unique within its PID namespace.
- The **`struct pid_namespace`** tracks the hierarchy of namespaces and manages the allocation of PIDs.
- The **`task_struct`** links the process to the PID and the PID namespace, allowing the kernel to manage 
  and schedule the process accordingly.
- The kernel ensures process isolation and proper mappings between PIDs in different namespaces, allowing 
  for processes in containers or isolated environments to appear as independent from the global system.

By understanding the **`struct pid`** and **`struct pid_namespace`** structures, you can see how Linux 
isolates processes across different namespaces while maintaining the ability to manage and track them at a 
system level.

# how to use eBPF 

To track the **`task_struct`** related to the PID of a process running inside a container using **eBPF**, 
the eBPF program can be run **on the host system**, but you need to carefully consider how PID namespaces 
work and how eBPF interacts with processes across different namespaces.

### Key Points to Consider:

1. **PID Namespace Isolation**: 
   Processes in a container run inside their own **PID namespace**, meaning they have isolated PIDs from 
   the host system. 
   A process inside the container might have PID 1, but its PID in the host system could be a different 
   (for example, PID 1234 on the host).

2. **eBPF Programs on the Host**: 
   eBPF programs are executed in the kernel, and typically, these programs operate on global system 
   resources. 
   They don't "know" about namespaces in the way user-space applications might, unless explicitly instructed. 

   - For example, an eBPF program that hooks into process lifecycle events 
     (such as `tracepoint` for `sched_process_fork` or `sched_process_exit`) will run on the **host** kernel.

   - These hooks will provide information about processes regardless of which namespace they belong to. 
     However, the program will report the process information as seen by the **host system**, including the
     PID from the host system’s perspective.

3. **Using eBPF to Track Container Processes**:

   - **On the Host**: You would run the eBPF program on the **host system** to track processes based on 
     their **global PID**. The host system sees processes with their host-side PID (e.g., PID 1234).

   - If you want to map the PID in the container's namespace to the PID in the host’s namespace, you can 
     use additional kernel features to track the relationship between the two. 
     For instance, `setns()` or `/proc/[pid]/ns/pid` files can help you correlate the PIDs in the container 
     to those in the host namespace.

4. **Accessing Process Information Across Namespaces**: 

   - eBPF programs like `sched_process_fork`, `sched_process_exit`, and `task_newtask` can be used to trace 
     process events, including creation and exit, across PID namespaces. 
     However, the eBPF program would need to correctly interpret and correlate the PIDs from different 
     namespaces.

   - The `pid_namespace` structure is part of the process's **`task_struct`**, so eBPF programs can use 
     kernel functions to get this information, even though the eBPF program itself runs in the host kernel.

   - You can use `bpf_get_current_pid_tgid()` to get the PID and TGID (Thread Group ID) of the current task 
     in the context of the host’s PID namespace. 
     If you're interested in the container’s PID namespace, you would have to track that relationship 
     through kernel features like `nsproxy` or process namespaces.

### Example Workflow of Using eBPF for Tracking Processes:

- **Step 1**: Write an eBPF program that hooks into the process lifecycle 
  (such as `sched_process_fork` or `sched_process_exit`) on the host.

- **Step 2**: Attach the eBPF program to the appropriate tracepoints 
  (or other events such as `sched_switch`).

- **Step 3**: When a new process is created inside a container, the eBPF program will be triggered on 
  the **host**.

  - The eBPF program will receive the process's PID in the host’s PID namespace, but you can use the 
    `nsproxy` or related kernel data structures to correlate that with the container's PID namespace.

- **Step 4**: The eBPF program can then report the PID and namespace information, possibly using the 
  **container's namespace information** to correlate the host-side PID with the container-side PID.

### Can eBPF be used to track container PID namespaces directly?

No, eBPF itself is tied to the kernel's perspective on the system, so it doesn't inherently "know" about 
container namespaces directly. However, you can achieve this by:

- **Accessing the `pid_namespace`** field of the `task_struct` using eBPF, which is part of the process’s 
  information.

- Using **additional tools** or **user-space programs** (such as `nsenter`, or reading `/proc/[pid]/ns/pid`)
  to map the PID in the container namespace to the PID in the host namespace.

### Where Should the eBPF Program Be Run?

- **On the Host System**: The eBPF program should run on the host kernel. This is because eBPF operates at 
  the kernel level, and the host kernel is the one that manages system-wide events, including those 
  triggered by processes running in containers.

- To track processes inside containers, the eBPF program can access the global PID of the process and, 
  with the help of **namespace tracking mechanisms**, determine which container namespace the process 
  belongs to.

### Example: Using eBPF to Trace Process Creation (from the Host's Perspective)

    ```c
    #include <linux/ptrace.h>
    #include <linux/sched.h>
    #include <linux/uaccess.h>
    #include <linux/bpf.h>
    #include <linux/if_ether.h>
    #include <linux/icmp.h>
    #include <linux/nsproxy.h>

    int track_pid(struct pt_regs *ctx) {
        struct task_struct *task;
        task = (struct task_struct *)bpf_get_current_task();
        
        // Get the PID in the host's namespace
        u32 pid = task->pid;

        // Optionally, track the PID namespace of the task
        struct pid_namespace *ns = task->nsproxy->pid_ns;
        
        // Do something with pid and ns (e.g., logging or processing)
        bpf_trace_printk("PID: %d, Namespace: %p\n", pid, ns);
        
        return 0;
    }
    ```

### Summary:

- **eBPF programs should run on the host system** to trace process-related events like `sched_process_fork` 
  or `sched_process_exit` that happen for processes in containers.

- From the eBPF program’s perspective, processes in containers will appear with their **host PID**, but the
  program can use **namespace information** (such as the `pid_namespace` in the `task_struct`) to correlate
  the host PID with the PID inside the container’s namespace.

- The **container’s PID** can be inferred from this mapping, but eBPF itself doesn’t inherently provide 
  container-specific PID isolation information; you need to use the kernel’s namespace structures to bridge 
  this gap.

#  performance metrics of container processes:

To **fetching performance metrics** from a container’s processes using **eBPF** or **perf** must be 
performed by running the eBPF program or **perf tools** on the **host system**, because:

1. **The host system manages the kernel**: 
   The kernel on the host system is the one that controls and manages system resources for all processes, 
   including those running inside containers. 
   It’s responsible for scheduling, resource accounting, and task management, regardless of which namespace 
   the processes belong to (e.g., a PID namespace within a container).

2. **Isolation at the PID level**: 
   Although containers use **PID namespaces** to provide isolation, the host kernel still tracks and 
   schedules all processes, including those inside containers, using its global PID space. 
   This means that performance metrics (e.g., CPU usage, memory consumption, I/O stats) are available from 
   the host's perspective, even though the container might have isolated PIDs.

### Key Insights:

- **eBPF and perf on the Host**: 

To collect performance metrics for containerized processes, the eBPF program or **perf tool** needs to run 
on the host system. Both tools operate at the kernel level and will gather metrics for the **global PIDs**. 
However, once you have the global PID (on the host system), you can still correlate it with the 
corresponding process inside the container's PID namespace.

- **Accessing Metrics for Containerized Processes**: 

The host system sees the containerized processes as regular kernel tasks, but those processes will have a 
different PID from the host's perspective. 

Therefore, eBPF or perf can be used on the host system to monitor these processes by tracking their 
**host-side PID** and correlating that with the container's PID using kernel data structures 
like `pid_namespace`.

### How This Works:

1. **eBPF Programs on the Host**: 

eBPF programs (like `sched_process_fork`, `sched_switch`, `task_newtask`, etc.) can trace events such as 
task creation, context switches, and task exit. 

These events are triggered at the kernel level for all processes on the system, including those running 
inside containers.
   
   - The eBPF program will capture the **global PID** of the process.

   - It can then use the **`task_struct`** to access additional information, including the 
     **PID namespace** that the process belongs to (which is stored in the `task_struct->nsproxy->pid_ns`).
   
   - For performance metrics such as CPU usage or memory stats, the eBPF program can use 
     **`bpf_perf_event_output()`** to collect and store data from performance events, and then track 
     CPU time, memory usage, etc., based on the process' PID.

2. **Using `perf`**: **perf** is another tool that can be used to collect performance data about processes. 
   Just like eBPF, **perf** runs on the host system and operates on the global PID space. 
   However, you can focus the data collection on containerized processes by filtering based on the 
   container's PID or cgroup ID.

   - **Perf Events**: You can use `perf` to record events such as CPU cycles, cache misses, context switches, 
   etc. These events can be filtered by container PID, but **perf itself works from the host’s perspective**, 
   so it’s tracking the global PID.
   
   - To narrow down to the container, you would typically use additional filters, such as the container’s 
   cgroup or namespace information. 
   You can link the container's PID to its host-side PID and use that with **perf** for 
   precise data collection.

### Practical Workflow Example:

- **On the Host System**:
  You use `bpf_trace_printk()` or `perf` to capture the process's metrics, including information like:
  - **CPU usage**
  - **Context switches**
  - **Memory usage**
  - **I/O activity**

- **Identifying Containerized Processes**: Since container processes have their own PID namespaces, 
  you will need to associate the **global PID** (seen by the host) with the container’s PID. 
  This can be done by checking the **namespace** of the process (via `task_struct->nsproxy->pid_ns`) or 
  using container-specific identifiers like **cgroup** IDs (e.g., `/sys/fs/cgroup`).

### Example: eBPF Program to Track CPU Usage in a Container

Here’s a basic example of an eBPF program that could track process events, including CPU usage, using 
`sched_switch` to observe context switches and monitor processes within a container:

    ```c
    #include <linux/sched.h>
    #include <linux/ptrace.h>
    #include <linux/bpf.h>
    #include <linux/if_ether.h>
    #include <linux/icmp.h>

    int track_cpu_usage(struct pt_regs *ctx) {
        struct task_struct *task;
        task = (struct task_struct *)bpf_get_current_task();

        // Get the global PID of the process (host PID)
        u32 pid = task->pid;

        // Get the container PID namespace (if needed)
        struct pid_namespace *ns = task->nsproxy->pid_ns;
        
        // If you want to filter by container, you can check the container's PID or cgroup
        // Example: Check if the PID is part of a specific cgroup (e.g., the container's cgroup)
        // struct cgroup *cg = task->cgroup;
        // if (cg matches container's cgroup) { ... }

        // Output the CPU usage or task info (for example, just print PID)
        bpf_trace_printk("PID: %d, Namespace: %p\n", pid, ns);
        
        return 0;
    }
    ```

### Example: Using `perf` to Monitor CPU Usage of a Containerized Process

You can use **`perf`** to track performance metrics of a containerized process by specifying the 
container's cgroup or PID.

```bash
# Example using perf to track CPU usage for a container's process
perf stat -e cpu-clock,task-clock,context-switches,cpu-migrations -p <container_pid>
```

In the above example:
- `<container_pid>` is the **global PID** of the container’s process, which you can obtain from the host system.
- You can use the container's cgroup ID (`perf` supports filtering by cgroup, so you can directly link 
  container processes based on their cgroup).

### Summary

- To fetch performance metrics from a container's processes, eBPF programs or perf tools must be run on the
  **host system**.

- Both **eBPF** and **perf** can track metrics for processes running inside containers, but they will see 
  the global PID, not the container's PID.

- To isolate and track container-specific metrics, you can use additional filters like the 
  **PID namespace** or **cgroup ID**, and correlate the global PID seen by the host with the PID in the 
  container's PID namespace.

- **eBPF** and **perf** provide powerful tools to gather detailed metrics, such as CPU usage, 
  context switches, memory consumption, etc., for processes running inside containers from the host's 
  perspective.
