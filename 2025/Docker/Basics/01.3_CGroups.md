# CGroups : Control Groups 

### 1. **What is CGroup (Control Groups)?**

**Control Groups (cgroups)** are a kernel feature that allows the Linux kernel to allocate, prioritize, 
manage, and isolate the resources (such as CPU, memory, disk I/O, network bandwidth) used by processes or 
groups of processes. 

Cgroups enable fine-grained control over resource usage and are essential for managing system resources in 
environments where multiple processes or containers are running.

With cgroups, system administrators or container orchestration tools can set limits on:

- **CPU usage**: Limit how much CPU time a group of processes can consume.
- **Memory usage**: Limit how much memory a group of processes can use.
- **I/O bandwidth**: Control the amount of disk I/O or network bandwidth available to processes.
- **Other resources**: Control other resources like network traffic or even process priority.

### 2. **How is CGroup Supported in the Linux Kernel?**

The Linux kernel implements cgroups by associating processes with a hierarchy of cgroup controllers, 
each responsible for managing a specific resource. 

These controllers interact with various subsystems to enforce limits and resource management policies.

The main cgroup features are:

- **Resource Allocation**: 
    You can allocate and limit resources to specific groups of processes.

- **Hierarchy**: 
    Cgroups are organized in a tree-like hierarchy. 
    Parent groups can allocate resources to their child groups.

- **Controllers**: 
    Cgroups use controllers that manage specific resources 
    (e.g., `cpu`, `memory`, `blkio` for block I/O, `net_cls` for network traffic).

#### - Key Components of Cgroups:

- **Cgroup Subsystems (Controllers)**:
  Each controller is responsible for managing a specific type of resource.

  - **`cpu`**: Manages CPU time allocation.

  - **`memory`**: Limits memory usage for a group of processes.

  - **`blkio`**: Limits and monitors I/O operations.

  - **`cpuacct`**: Monitors the CPU usage of a group.

  - **`net_cls`**: Manages network traffic isolation and classification.

  - **`pids`**: Limits the number of processes in a cgroup.

- **Cgroup Filesystem**: Cgroups are mounted in a virtual filesystem (`cgroupfs`), where administrators can
  configure resource limits by writing values to specific files under `/sys/fs/cgroup/`.

### 3. **Which Files of Kernel Source Can Be Refer'd for CGroup Support?**

The implementation of cgroups is distributed across several parts of the kernel source code. 
The primary files related to cgroup support include:

    1. **`kernel/cgroup.c`**: is the core implementation of the cgroup functionality. 
    It's code for managing cgroups, including creating, destroying, and moving processes between cgroups.

    2. **`include/linux/cgroup.h`**: Contains the definitions and structures used by cgroup functionality, 
    such as `struct cgroup` and `struct cgroup_subsys`.

    3. **`fs/cgroup.c`**: Implements the cgroup filesystem interface (`cgroupfs`), where resources are 
    controlled by reading and writing files. 
    This is the interface that users and tools (e.g., `systemd`, Docker) interact with.

    4. **`kernel/cpuset.c`**: Handles CPU and memory affinity within cgroups, which is part of the 
    **`cpuset`** controller, allowing users to specify which CPUs or memory nodes a group of processes 
    should run on.

    5. **`kernel/sched/`**: Contains scheduling-related code, especially in the **`cpu`** controller, which
    manages how CPU time is allocated to processes in cgroups.

    6. **`kernel/resource.c`**: Manages the allocation of kernel resources, including the `memory` 
    controller, which tracks memory usage by cgroups and enforces limits.

    7. **`net/`**: The **`net_cls`** and **`net_prio`** controllers for managing network traffic are 
    implemented in this directory. 
    The **`net_cls`** controller allows for classifying network traffic into different groups.

    8. **`block/`**: Contains code for the **`blkio`** controller, which handles disk I/O resource control.


### 4. **How is CGroup Used in Containers?**

Cgroups are extensively used in containers to ensure that each container gets the appropriate amount of 
system resources (CPU, memory, I/O, etc.), and to prevent any container from monopolizing the system's 
resources. 

In containerized environments, cgroups play the following roles:

- **Resource Limiting**: Containers can be assigned resource limits, such as a maximum amount of CPU time, 
  memory, or disk I/O. 
  This ensures that one container cannot affect the performance of others by consuming too many resources.
  - Ex, Docker allows setting resource limits for containers using`--memory`, `--cpus`, and other flags.
  
- **Resource Accounting**: Cgroups are used to track the amount of resources (CPU, memory, I/O, etc.) 
  consumed by each container. 
  This information can be accessed to monitor the performance of containers and to enforce limits.

- **Resource Isolation**: Containers can be isolated from each other, ensuring that they don't interfere 
  with one another's resource usage. 
  For Ex, a container's network bandwidth can be limited, or a container's CPU usage can be restricted, 
  preventing it from impacting other containers on the same host.

- **Example in Docker**:
  When you run a container using Docker, it internally uses cgroups to control how much CPU time, memory, 
  and other resources the container can use. 
  You can specify these limits when creating a container. 
  For example, to limit the memory to 1GB for a Docker container, you might use:
  ```bash
  docker run --memory="1g" my_container
  ```
- **Kubernetes**: Kubernetes also uses cgroups to manage the resources of containers in a pod. 
  The resources allocated to each pod (CPU, memory, etc.) are controlled by cgroups. 
  Kubernetes uses these to enforce the resource requests and limits defined in the pod specification.

### 5. **How is CGroup Related to or Used Along with Namespaces?**

While **namespaces** and **cgroups** both provide process isolation, they focus on different aspects of 
isolation:

- **Namespaces**: 
    Provide isolation of system resources, making processes think they are running in separate environments 
    (e.g., independent network stacks, process IDs, mount points).

- **Cgroups**: Provide control and limit the resources (CPU, memory, I/O, etc.) that processes or groups of 
  processes can consume.

#### Interaction Between Namespaces and Cgroups:

In containerized environments (like Docker or Kubernetes), **namespaces and cgroups work together** to 
provide both **resource isolation** and **resource control**.

- **Namespaces**: Ensure that processes within a container see their own independent environment, including 
  their own network stack, PID space, and file system.

- **Cgroups**: Enforce resource limits on these isolated environments, ensuring that each container gets a 
  fair share of system resources and doesn’t overconsume them.

For example:
- **Network namespaces** allow containers to have their own network interfaces, IP addresses, and 
  routing tables.

- **Cgroups** ensure that the container doesn’t consume more than its allocated CPU or memory resources, 
  even though it has its own network stack in a separate namespace.

### Example in Containers:

In Docker, when creating a container:

- A **new network namespace** is created so the container has its own virtual network stack.

- A **new PID namespace** is created so the container has its own process IDs.

- A **cgroup** is created to limit and monitor the CPU and memory resources available to the container.

#### Example: Docker Resource Allocation with Cgroups and Namespaces:
    ```bash
    $ docker run --memory="512m" --cpus="1.0" --name container1 my_image
    ```
In this example:

- **Cgroups** are used to limit the container’s memory to 512 MB and CPU to 1 CPU core.
- **Namespaces** are used to isolate the container’s networking, PID, and filesystem.

### Summary:

- **Cgroups** (Control Groups) are a kernel feature that allows fine-grained control over resources 
  (CPU, memory, I/O, etc.) for groups of processes. 
  They are essential for managing and limiting resources in multi-tenant systems such as containers.

- **Kernel Support**: Cgroups are implemented in files like 
  `kernel/cgroup.c`, `fs/cgroup.c`, `kernel/sched/`, `net/`, and `block/`.

- **Containers** use cgroups to limit and track resource consumption, ensuring that containers don't 
  interfere with each other’s performance.

- **Namespaces** and **cgroups** work together in containers: n
  amespaces provide isolation of system resources, 
  while cgroups control and limit the amount of those resources.
