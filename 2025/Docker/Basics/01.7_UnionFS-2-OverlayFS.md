# UnionFS:
---

**UnionFS (Union File System)** is a **filesystem** that allows **multiple directories** 
(often called **branches**) to be **merged** or "stacked" together, creating a **single unified view**. 
This means that files from different directories or filesystems can be combined into one, without having to 
physically copy or move the files.

### Key Concepts of UnionFS:
- **Union of Directories**: UnionFS allows you to mount multiple directories (or file systems) in such a 
  way that the contents of all these directories appear to be one, even though they are physically stored 
  in separate locations.

- **Layered File System**: The directories can be thought of as layers stacked on top of each other.
  The topmost layer is considered the most recent or active layer, and files in this layer take precedence 
  over those in the lower layers.
  
- **Read-Only and Writable Layers**: Typically, one layer is read-only, and changes 
  (such as file modifications or new files) are written to a separate **writable layer**. 
  The read-only layers are left untouched, and any changes made do not affect the original data.

### How UnionFS Works:
UnionFS creates a "merged" view of files from different source directories. 

For example, consider the following:
- **Layer 1 (Read-Only)**: `/dir1/`
- **Layer 2 (Read-Only)**: `/dir2/`
- **Layer 3 (Writable)**: `/dir3/`

When UnionFS is used, these three directories could appear as a single directory (`/merged/`), with the 
following behavior:

1. **File Access**: When you access a file, UnionFS checks the layers in order (from top to bottom). 
   If the file exists in the writable layer, it is accessed there; otherwise, it looks for it in the 
   read-only layers.

2. **File Changes**: If a file is modified in the writable layer, the modification is only reflected there. 
   The original data in the read-only layers remains unchanged.

3. **File Creation**: If a new file is created, UnionFS creates it in the writable layer. 
   The read-only layers remain unaffected.

### Use Cases of UnionFS:

- **Containerization (e.g., Docker)**: 
  In container systems like Docker, UnionFS is used for creating image layers. 

  Each layer is read-only, and changes or additions (e.g., installing packages) happen in the writable layer
  This approach allows efficient image management and reuse of layers.

- **Software Deployment**: 
  UnionFS can be useful in scenarios where you want to manage different versions of software without 
  modifying the original files. 
  For example, a system might maintain several versions of an application, and you can switch between them 
  without duplicating the files.

- **Live CD/Live Systems**: 
  UnionFS allows Live CD systems to be read-only, while changes to the system 
  (like installing software or changing configurations) can be written to a separate layer. 
  This ensures that the system remains unchanged upon reboot, but changes can be persisted if needed.

### Benefits of UnionFS:
- **Efficiency**: By stacking layers, UnionFS avoids duplicating data and reduces storage usage, as files 
  that appear in multiple directories don’t need to be copied.

- **Flexibility**: You can combine directories from different locations, and the filesystem can be dynamic, 
  allowing changes to be written to specific layers.

- **Non-Destructive**: Since read-only layers are preserved, UnionFS can be used in situations where the 
  underlying data should not be altered (e.g., system images, container images).

### Common Implementations of UnionFS:
- **OverlayFS**: 
  A more modern version of UnionFS, widely used in container environments like Docker. 
  OverlayFS is a simple and efficient implementation that supports the "union" of two directories.

- **AUFS (Another Union File System)**: 
  Another implementation that was popular in earlier Docker versions. 
  AUFS allows stacking multiple directories and is used in some Linux distributions.

- **UnionFS-Fuse**: 
  A user-space implementation of UnionFS that works using the FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) framework. 
  It’s less commonly used in production but can be helpful for specific applications.

### Conclusion:

UnionFS is a versatile filesystem that provides the ability to combine multiple directories into a single
unified view, with layers that can be read-only or writable. 
This makes it particularly useful in containerization, versioned software systems, and environments where 
multiple layers need to be managed efficiently, such as Docker images or live systems.

# OverlayFS:

**OverlayFS** has largely **replaced UnionFS** in many modern environments, especially in 
**containerization** (e.g., Docker) and **Kubernetes**. 

OverlayFS is **faster**, **simpler**, and more **efficient** than UnionFS for creating layered filesystems.
It has become the default choice for many container runtimes (including Docker) and is a crucial part of 
how **Kubernetes** and container orchestration platforms manage **container images and layers**.

### 1. **OverlayFS for Kubernetes**
   - **Industry Standard**: **OverlayFS** is the **default** filesystem for containerized environments, 
   including **Docker**, **Podman**, and most Kubernetes setups. 

   Kubernetes uses **container runtimes** like Docker or containerd, which rely heavily on OverlayFS 
   (or similar union filesystems like **overlay2**) for image layering and efficient storage management.

   - **Container Image Management**: OverlayFS is at the core of how **images are layered** in 
   Docker/Kubernetes. 
   Containers use layered images, with each layer being read-only, and OverlayFS helps create these layers 
   efficiently.

   - **Performance and Efficiency**: OverlayFS is a **more modern** and **performance-optimized** solution 
   compared to UnionFS. Understanding OverlayFS will help you troubleshoot container storage issues, 
   manage images effectively, and improve Kubernetes cluster performance.

### 2. **Kubernetes and OverlayFS: Use Cases**
   - In Kubernetes, containers are often backed by a **container runtime** like **Docker** or **containerd**, 
   which in turn uses **OverlayFS** for managing container images. When you are working with persistent 
   storage (like **Persistent Volumes**, **StatefulSets**, or **Storage Classes**), understanding how 
   container images and layers are managed by OverlayFS helps you design efficient and performant 
   Kubernetes storage solutions.

   - **OverlayFS and Kubernetes Volumes**: If you need to work with local storage or troubleshoot issues 
   with container file systems (like volume mounts or persistent storage in Kubernetes), 
   OverlayFS is a key technology to understand.

### OverlayFS:

**OverlayFS** is a **union filesystem** for Linux that allows you to merge multiple directories (or layers) 
into a single unified view. 

It’s particularly useful for creating lightweight and efficient file systems, especially in containerized 
environments like Docker and Kubernetes, where multiple img layers need to be stacked and merged seamlessly. 

In simpler terms, **OverlayFS** enables the layering of filesystems, where each layer can be **read-only** 
or **writable**, with changes happening in the topmost writable layer, while the underlying layers remain 
untouched.

Here’s an in-depth explanation of **OverlayFS**, how it works, and its key components:

### Key Concepts of OverlayFS:
1. **Layers**: OverlayFS works by stacking multiple directories or filesystems on top of each other, 
   forming **layers**. The files in each layer are merged to create a unified view.
   
2. **Read-Only and Writable Layers**:
   - **Lower layers** are typically read-only. These layers are immutable and cannot be modified.
   - **Upper layer** is writable. This is where any changes to the filesystem (such as creating new files 
     or modifying existing ones) happen.

3. **Unified View**: 
   - OverlayFS presents a unified view of the combined layers. 
     When you access a file or directory in the mounted filesystem, it appears as though it’s all part of 
     the same filesystem, even though it's coming from different layers.

   - If a file exists in multiple layers, the **uppermost layer** (the writable one) takes precedence. 
     If the file doesn’t exist in the upper layer, OverlayFS looks for it in the lower layers.

### How OverlayFS Works:

OverlayFS works by combining multiple directories into a **single directory**, with the following layers 
involved:

1. **Lower Directory** (Read-Only): This is the first layer and usually contains the base files 
   (Ex: the base OS or container image). Files in this layer are immutable and can’t be modified directly.
   
2. **Upper Directory** (Writable): This is the second layer, where changes are made. 
   This layer is **writable**, so any new files added,or changes made to existing files,occur in this layer.

3. **Merged View**: The **merged directory** is the final output that combines both the **lower** and 
   **upper** directories into a single unified view. The lower layers are visible in the merged directory, 
   but any changes (such as modifications or new files) appear in the upper directory. 

   This merged view allows you to interact with the filesystem as if it’s one, even though it’s made up of 
   separate layers.

### Example Scenario:
Consider the following example:
- **Lower Layer** (Read-Only): `/lower/` contains the base image or OS files.
- **Upper Layer** (Writable): `/upper/` contains any changes, such as new files or modifications.

When OverlayFS is mounted with `/lower/` as the lower layer and `/upper/` as the writable layer, the merged 
directory (`/merged/`) will provide a unified view:
- If a file exists in both layers, the version in the **upper layer** will be used.
- If a file exists only in the lower layer, it will be visible in the merged view as it is.
- If a file is added to the upper layer, it will appear in the merged directory, but only in the 
**upper layer**.

### Example Filesystem Structure:

```
Lower Layer (Read-Only):
/lower/file1.txt
/lower/file2.txt

Upper Layer (Writable):
/upper/file1.txt  (modified or added)
/upper/file3.txt  (new file)

Merged View:
/merged/file1.txt  (file1 from upper layer)
/merged/file2.txt  (file2 from lower layer)
/merged/file3.txt  (new file from upper layer)
```

### Key Features of OverlayFS:

1. **Copy-on-Write (COW)**:

   - When a file is modified, OverlayFS doesn’t modify the original file in the lower layer. 
     Instead, it **copies** the file to the upper layer and applies the changes there. 
     This is known as **copy-on-write** (COW).

   - For ex, if you modify a file in the lower layer, it’s copied to the upper layer first, and the 
     modification happens on that copy.

2. **Efficient Layering**:

   - OverlayFS allows for **efficient storage management** by avoiding the duplication of files between 
   layers. If a file is common between layers, it only exists once in the underlying layers.

   - The layering concept allows for **reusability**: different containers, for example, can share the same 
   base layers (e.g., an OS image), while only adding unique layers (e.g., installed packages) on top.

3. **Performance**:

   - **OverlayFS** is **fast** because it minimizes file duplication and performs efficient lookups. 
   The system doesn’t need to replicate files between layers—only differences are stored in the upper layers.

   - It reduces the overhead of creating or modifying files compared to a traditional filesystem where 
   every change may involve copying or moving data.

4. **Compatibility with Docker and Kubernetes**:

   - In containerized environments, OverlayFS is commonly used by **Docker** and **containerd** to manage 
   container layers. 
   Each container image is made up of several layers, with the final image being a combination of base 
   layers and any added layers (e.g., installed software, configuration).

   - **Kubernetes** relies on container runtimes like **Docker** or **containerd**, which in turn use 
   OverlayFS to efficiently manage the storage of container images.

### OverlayFS vs. Other Union Filesystems:

- **OverlayFS vs. UnionFS**: While both are **union filesystems**, OverlayFS is a more modern, **simpler**, 
  and **more efficient** implementation. 
  It was added to the Linux kernel in 2014 and has since become the default option for managing container 
  images and layers.

- **OverlayFS vs. AUFS**: AUFS (Another Union File System) was another union filesystem that was used 
  in Docker before OverlayFS became mainstream. **OverlayFS** is favored for its simplicity and better 
  kernel integration, as AUFS requires external patches for the kernel.

### Use Cases of OverlayFS:

#### 1. **Docker and Kubernetes**:
   - **Docker** uses OverlayFS to efficiently manage layers in container images. 
   Each image is built using layers, and OverlayFS helps combine these layers in a performant and 
   space-efficient way.

   - **Kubernetes** also relies on container runtimes (e.g., Docker or containerd), which use OverlayFS 
   to manage the container image layers.

#### 2. **Live Systems**:
   - **Live CDs** or **Live USBs** can use OverlayFS to create a read-only base system while allowing 
   changes to be written to a separate upper layer. 
   This allows users to try out a system without modifying the original disk image.

3. **Immutable Infrastructure**:
   - OverlayFS is used in scenarios where you need **immutable infrastructure**, like containers, where the 
   base system should not be changed, but changes can still be made at the upper layer 
   (e.g., adding logs, modifying configurations).


# OverlayFS Examples:

How to use **OverlayFS** on a **Linux** system for testing and experimenting. 

These examples will show how to set up OverlayFS with two directories (one read-only and one writable) and 
demonstrate how to merge them into a unified view.

- Check the running linux system supports overlayfs:

    ` cat /proc/filesystems | grep overlay`
---

### Example 1: Basic OverlayFS Setup
Here we create a basic OverlayFS setup with a **lower** (read-only) layer and an **upper** (writable) layer.

#### Step 1: Create Directories for Testing

```bash
mkdir /tmp/lower /tmp/upper /tmp/workdir /tmp/merged
```

- `/tmp/lower`: The read-only directory (lower layer).
- `/tmp/upper`: The writable directory (upper layer).
- `/tmp/workdir`: A temporary directory used by OverlayFS to perform internal operations.
- `/tmp/merged`: The directory where the merged view of both layers will be mounted.

#### Step 2: Populate Lower Layer

Create some files in the **lower** directory:

```bash
echo "This is a file in the lower layer" > /tmp/lower/file1.txt
echo "This is another file in the lower layer" > /tmp/lower/file2.txt
```

#### Step 3: Mount OverlayFS

Now, let's mount the OverlayFS, using the **lower** directory (read-only) and the **upper** directory 
(writable), and merge them into the **merged** directory:

```bash
sudo mount -t overlay overlay -o lowerdir=/tmp/lower,upperdir=/tmp/upper,workdir=/tmp/workdir /tmp/merged
```

- `lowerdir`: The read-only lower directory.
- `upperdir`: The writable upper directory.
- `workdir`: A temporary work directory for OverlayFS to manage its operations.
- `/tmp/merged`: The final directory where the unified view of both layers will be available.

#### Step 4: Check Merged View

Now, if you list the contents of the `/tmp/merged` directory, you will see the files from the lower layer:

```bash
ls /tmp/merged
```

You should see:
```
file1.txt  file2.txt
```

These files come from the lower (read-only) layer.

#### Step 5: Modify the Merged View

Now, let's modify the merged view by adding new files to the **upper** (writable) layer:

```bash
echo "This file was created in the upper layer" > /tmp/upper/file3.txt
```

Check the `/tmp/merged` directory again:

```bash
ls /tmp/merged
```

You should now see:
```
file1.txt  file2.txt  file3.txt
```

- `file3.txt` comes from the **upper layer**.
- The files `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` are still from the **lower layer** and are unchanged.

#### Step 6: Modify a Lower Layer File (Copy-on-Write)

Let’s modify an existing file from the lower layer. For example, we modify `file1.txt`:

```bash
echo "This is an update to file1 in the upper layer" > /tmp/upper/file1.txt
```

After checking `/tmp/merged` again:

```bash
cat /tmp/merged/file1.txt
```

You will see:
```
This is an update to file1 in the upper layer
```

- Even though `file1.txt` existed in the lower layer, the change was applied in the **upper layer** via 
  the **copy-on-write** mechanism.
- The **lower layer** file remains unchanged, but OverlayFS has copied it to the upper layer to enable the 
  modification.

#### Step 7: Clean Up

Once you are done testing, you can unmount the OverlayFS setup:

```bash
sudo umount /tmp/merged
```

### Example 2: Using OverlayFS for Containers (Docker)

If you have Docker installed, you can observe OverlayFS in action in a **containerized environment**.

1. **Check Docker Storage Driver**:
   Docker uses OverlayFS as its default storage driver for managing images and containers.

   Check which storage driver Docker is using:

   ```bash
   docker info | grep Storage
   ```

   You should see something like this:

   ```
   Storage Driver: overlay2
   ```

   - This confirms that Docker is using **OverlayFS (specifically `overlay2`)** for managing container images.

2. **Run a Container**:
   Run a simple Docker container, such as the official **Ubuntu** container:

   ```bash
   docker run -it ubuntu bash
   ```

   This will start an Ubuntu container, and inside the container, the filesystem is backed by **OverlayFS**.

3. **Test OverlayFS with the Container**:
   While inside the container, create a new file:

   ```bash
   echo "This is a test file in the container" > /testfile.txt
   ```

   Now, exit the container and inspect the underlying image layers:

   ```bash
   docker ps -a
   ```

   You can inspect the image layers using `docker inspect <container_id>` to understand how Docker is 
   using OverlayFS to manage the layers.

   **Note**: The `overlay2` driver in Docker works very similarly to the manual OverlayFS setup in the 
   previous example, but Docker automates many of the complexities, such as managing writable and read-only 
   layers for containers.

---

### Conclusion

These examples give you a hands-on introduction to **OverlayFS** on a Linux system. You can:

- **Mount OverlayFS manually** to understand how it works with layered filesystems.
- **Test Copy-on-Write** by modifying files in the upper layer.
- Use Docker to observe **OverlayFS in action** as the default storage driver for containers.

By testing these scenarios, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of how OverlayFS works and how it is used in 
modern containerization systems like **Docker** and **Kubernetes**.
