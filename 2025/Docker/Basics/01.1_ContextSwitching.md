# Context Switching

### 1. **Linux Kernel's Ability for Context Switching (User Space & Kernel Space)**

#### Context Switching:
Context switching is the process of storing the state of a running process and restoring the state of 
another process. 
In the context of an operating system, context switching allows multiple processes to share a single CPU 
core by switching between them quickly, giving the illusion of parallel execution.

**Context switching in Linux** involves saving and loading the CPU's state (ex: registers, program counter)
between two different contexts. 
This happens in two main scenarios:

- **User space to Kernel space**: 
    This occurs when a process performs a system call (e.g., I/O operation, memory allocation). 
    The context is switched from user space to kernel space to execute the kernel code.

- **Kernel space to User space**: 
    After a system call is completed, the kernel switches back to user space, returning control to the app 
    with the result.

The actual process of switching contexts between user space and kernel space is managed by the 
**Linux scheduler**, which decides which process runs next based on priority, resource usage, etc.

Context switching is handled by the OS kernel's scheduler and profiled using eBPF/Perf.

- **Multithreading and Processes**: 
Developers can create multiple threads or processes that will be context-switched by the Linux kernel. 
Threads in user space share the same memory space, while processes do not. 

This means that, from a program's perspective:
  - **Thread Context Switching**: kernel switches between threads in the same process.

  - **Process Context Switching**: kernel switches between different processes (with their own mem space).
  
- **Using System Calls**: Developers can trigger context switches to kernel space by using system calls 
(e.g., file I/O, network requests, memory management). 

For instance, an I/O operation causes a process to transition into kernel space to interact with HW or FS.
  
  Example:
  ```c
  #include <stdio.h>
  #include <unistd.h>

  int main() {
      printf("In user space\n");
      // A system call context switch to kernel space
      sleep(2); // Causes the kernel to switch to another process
      printf("Back to user space after sleep\n");
      return 0;
  }
  ```

- **Asynchronous I/O**: In user-space applications, asynchronous I/O can trigger context switches without 
blocking the process, allowing other processes or threads to run during I/O operations.

- **Signals**: Signals like `SIGSTOP`, `SIGKILL`, etc., can interrupt a process and trigger context switches.

- **Timers**: Setting timers (using `setitimer()`, `alarm()`, etc.) can result in periodic context switches,
allowing processes to execute at scheduled intervals.

### 3. **Context Switching in Containers**

Containers, such as those managed by Docker or Kubernetes, use the underlying Linux kernel for process 
isolation and context switching. 

Containers share the kernel of the host machine but are isolated from each other. 
This isolation is achieved through "namespaces" and "cgroups", which control the resource allocation and 
process separation.

**Container context switching** works as follows:
- The kernel performs context switching between different containers in the same way it switches between 
  processes.

- Containers are treated as processes by the kernel, so any task in the container (whether it's I/O, memory 
  access, or CPU usage) can result in context switching between the container and other processes.

- The use of **cgroups** ensures that each container's CPU time, memory usage, and other resources are 
  managed and isolated, which may affect the frequency or priorities of context switches between containers.
 
For example, if a container runs a process, it can be scheduled by the kernel for execution. 
The container will use system calls to interact with kernel space, leading to context switching.

### 4. **Using eBPF & perf for Profiling Context Switching**

#### eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter):

eBPF is a powerful tool in the Linux kernel that allows developers to run custom code in the kernel context 
(without modifying the kernel code itself). 

eBPF can be used to trace system activities, including context switches.

- **Tracing Context Switches with eBPF**: eBPF can be used to hook into specific kernel events related to 
process scheduling. For ex, you can trace when the kernel switches between processes and gather statistics 
on context switch frequency, process duration, and other relevant metrics.

  Example: Tracing context switches with eBPF using `bpftrace`:

  ```bash
  sudo bpftrace -e \
  'tracepoint:sched:sched_switch {printf("Context Switch: %s -> %s\n", args->prev_comm, args->next_comm); }'
  ```
  1. The identifiers to use in bpftrace for the sched:sched_switch tracepoint are 
      "args->prev_comm" and "args->next_comm".

  2. "args->prev_comm" refers to the name of the process that was previously running 
     (i.e. the process being switched out of).
     
     "args->next_comm" refers to the name of the process that is now running 
     (i.e., the process being switched into).

  This will print out the processes involved in context switches.

  Extending the above trace to print the time information at context switching:
  `bpftrace` `time` function to print the time in seconds since the epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC). 

  `sudo bpftrace -e 'tracepoint:sched:sched_switch \
    { printf("Context Switch: %s -> %s at %lu.%09lu\n", \
              args->prev_comm, \
              args->next_comm, \
              nsecs / 1000000000, \
              nsecs % 1000000000); }'`
  or 
  use the `nsecs` built-in variable in `bpftrace` to print the time at context switching
  `sudo bpftrace -e \
        'tracepoint:sched:sched_switch \
        { printf("Context Switch: %s -> %s at %llu\n", args->prev_comm, args->next_comm, nsecs); }'
  .....
  Context Switch: wezterm-gui -\> kworker/u16:2 at 7415231377081
  Context Switch: kworker/u16:2 -\> wezterm-gui at 7415231380880
  Context Switch: wezterm-gui -\> kworker/u16:2 at 7415231387533
  Lost 1 events 
  Context Switch: wezterm-gui -\> kworker/u16:2 at 7415231397960
  Lost 3 events
  `
  Note: in the above log "Lost events" tells that `bpftrace` was unable to capture and process one or more
  events that occurred during the tracing period. The reasons can be "buffer overflow", "cpu loading", "bpf
  program complexity", "interrupt handling". The buffer size can be changed by adding additional argument to
  `bpftrace` cmd as "-b 100000" or by reducing tracing period ( reduce overhead of event processing)

- **eBPF and Containers**: In containers, eBPF can also trace process context switches, helping developers 
  monitor and optimize the resource usage of processes within the container. Allowing fine-grained 
  monitoring of containerized workloads and understanding how context switching is affecting performance.

#### perf (Linux Performance Counters):

`perf` is a tool that interfaces with the kernel's performance counters to collect and analyze performance 
data, including context switches.

- **Profiling Context Switches with perf**:
  The `perf` command can track the number of context switches occurring within the system, helping identify
  performance bottlenecks and areas where context switching might be too frequent.

  Example: To track context switches with `perf`, you can use:
  ```bash
  sudo perf stat -e context-switches -p <pid>
  ```

  This command will report the number of context switches for the process with the given PID.

- **Using perf with Containers**: `perf` can be run inside the container or on the host system to profile 
  the context switching between containerized processes. 
  By tracking context switches, developers can gain insights into CPU resource utilization and optimize the 
  performance of their containerized applications.

### Summary:

- **Context Switching** allows multiple processes or threads to share CPU resources. 
  The Linux kernel handles the transition between user space and kernel space.

- Developers can trigger context switching through system calls, multithreading, or process management.

- Containers utilize the underlying Linux kernel’s context switching mechanisms to manage isolated workloads.

- **eBPF** and **perf** are tools that can help monitor and profile context switches, which is useful for 
  performance optimization. 

  eBPF can trace system events, while `perf` provides detailed statistics on context switching, both in 
  general and for containerized workloads.

### 1. **Kernel Source : Context Switching?**

Linux kernel, context switching is primarily defined and managed by the **scheduler**. 

The relevant parts of the kernel src that deal with context switching are located in files:
    - **`kernel/sched/`**: contains the core scheduling logic, including the funs for context switching. 
      The most important files related to context switching are:

      - **`kernel/sched/core.c`**: The main scheduling funs that handle context switching. 
      Functions like `schedule()` are central to context switching.

      - **`kernel/sched/fair.c`**: Handles the **Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)**, which is the default 
        scheduling algorithm used by Linux. 
        It plays a significant role in the decision-making process for which process gets CPU time, 
        impacting how context switching occurs.

      - **`kernel/sched/rt.c`**: code for **real-time scheduling**. 
        Real-time tasks have higher priority and may cause more frequent context switches.

      - **`arch/` (Architecture-specific code)**: Arch-specific code defines low-level context switching 
        details, saving and restoring registers, CPU state, and switching between user and kernel modes. 
        The files under this directory contain platform-specific implementations for context switching.

      - **`arch/x86/kernel/process.c`** (for x86-based systems): This is where low-level context switching 
        routines like `switch_to()` reside, which perform the actual task switch by saving the current 
        process's state and loading the new process’s state.

      - **`arch/<architecture>/kernel/`**: In the case of non-x86 architectures (e.g., ARM, PowerPC), 
      the corresponding architecture-specific code is located here. 

### 2. **Does the Kernel Support Different Context Switching Algorithms?**

Linux kernel does support different scheduling algorithms, which can influence the frequency and type of 
context switching. It's important to note that **context switching** itself is a mechanism handled by the 
scheduler and doesn't directly involve different algorithms. 
Instead, **different algorithms** affect how and when the kernel decides to switch between tasks 
(processes or threads).

Main scheduling algorithms in the Linux kernel:

#### 1. **Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)**:
   - **CFS** is the default and most commonly used scheduler in Linux. 
     uses a **red-black tree** to track processes and assigns CPU time in a way that is intended to be fair 
     to all running processes.

   - CFS aims to ensure that all processes get a fair share of the CPU, adjusting the time slices 
     dynamically depending on the priority and recent execution of each process.

   - Context switches in CFS occur when the kernel decides that another process should be given a turn to 
     execute. This decision is based on a process's "virtual runtime," which keeps track of how long each 
     process has been running.

   Relevant code: **`kernel/sched/fair.c`**

#### 2. **Real-Time Scheduling (SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR)**:
   - **SCHED_FIFO (First In, First Out)** and **SCHED_RR (Round Robin)** are two real-time scheduling 
     policies that give priority to processes that need to meet strict timing requirements.

   - Real-time processes have higher priority than regular (CFS-scheduled) processes, and context switching 
     occurs as soon as a higher-priority real-time task becomes runnable, preempting lower-priority tasks.

   - **SCHED_FIFO** schedules tasks based on their arrival time (first-come, first-served).

   - **SCHED_RR** behaves similarly to SCHED_FIFO but allows real-time tasks to yield the CPU voluntarily 
     after a fixed time slice (i.e., round-robin scheduling within real-time tasks).

   Relevant code: **`kernel/sched/rt.c`**

#### 3. **Fair Group Scheduling (CFS with Grouping)**:
   - **Fair Group Scheduling** builds on CFS but allows the kernel to treat groups of processes 
   (e.g., in a cgroup) as a single entity and allocate CPU time accordingly.

   - This is useful in containerized environments where multiple containers are running on the same host, 
     and you want to ensure that resources are shared fairly between the containers.

   Relevant code: **`kernel/sched/fair.c` (with cgroup integration)**

#### 4. **Deadline Scheduling (SCHED_DEADLINE)**:
   - **SCHED_DEADLINE** is used for tasks with hard deadlines. 
     The kernel attempts to meet deadlines by ensuring that tasks are scheduled and executed within a 
     specified time window.

   - This type of scheduling requires more complex algorithms and context-switching strategies to prioritize
     tasks according to their deadlines.
   
   Relevant code: **`kernel/sched/deadline.c`**

#### 5. **Idle Scheduling (SCHED_IDLE)**:
   - The **SCHED_IDLE** policy is used for tasks that run only when no other runnable tasks are available, 
     typically used for background tasks.

   - It ensures that CPU time is given to more important tasks first, and context switching happens only 
     when the CPU is idle.

   Relevant code: **`kernel/sched/idle.c`**

### 3. **Summary: Key Kernel Components Involved in Context Switching**

- **Scheduling Algorithms**: Different scheduling algorithms define when and how context switching happens, 
  including CFS, real-time, fair group scheduling, and others.

- **Low-Level Context Switching**: The actual mechanism of context switching, such as saving and restoring 
  registers, stack pointers, and other processor states, is handled in the architecture-specific files 
  (e.g., `arch/x86/kernel/process.c`).

- **Scheduler Core**: The core logic for scheduling, which controls when to invoke context switching based 
  on the chosen algorithm, resides in **`kernel/sched/`**.

### Key Functions for Context Switching:

- **`schedule()`**: This is the main function in the kernel's scheduler that decides which task to run next 
  and triggers the context switch.

- **`switch_to()`**: This function actually performs the context switch by saving the state of the current 
  process and loading the state of the next one. It is highly architecture-specific.

### Conclusion:
The Linux kernel supports multiple scheduling algorithms (e.g., CFS, SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR, SCHED_DEADLINE) 
that influence how context switching occurs. 
However, the basic mechanism of context switching—saving and restoring process states—is handled in the 
kernel’s scheduler code, with architecture-specific files performing the low-level task switching. 

Developers can choose or configure different scheduling algorithms, particularly in real-time or 
containerized environments, depending on the performance requirements of their applications.
