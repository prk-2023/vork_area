# Docker Foundational Topics:
---

### Prerequisite topics: 

(Optional) understand the Linux kernel's role in containerization to start using Docker, can be helpful: 

1. **Context switching**: ( 01.1_ContextSwitching.md ) 
    Containers rely on the Linux kernel's ability to switch between different contexts, 
    which allows multiple containers to run on the same host. 
    Understanding how context switching works can help you appreciate the efficiency of containers.

2. **Namespace isolation**: 
    Linux kernel provides namespace isolation, which allows containers to have their own isolated env's.
    Knowing how namespaces work helps in understand how containers are isolated from each other.

3. **Control groups (cgroups)**: 
    Cgroups are a Linux kernel feature that allows for resource allocation and limitation. 
    Understanding cgroups can help you manage resources for your containers.

4. **File system hierarchy**: 
    Containers use a shared file system hierarchy, which can be confusing if you're not familiar with how 
    the Linux kernel manages file systems.

**Key Linux kernel concepts for containerization**

1. **Namespaces**: Namespaces provide isolation for containers, allowing them to have their own:
        * Process IDs (PID)
        * Network interfaces (NET)
        * Mount points (MNT)
        * Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
        * User IDs (USER)

2. **Control groups (cgroups)**: Cgroups allow for resource allocation and limitation, including:
        * CPU usage
        * Memory usage
        * I/O usage

3. **File system hierarchy**: Containers use a shared file system hierarchy, which includes:
        * Root file system (rootfs)
        * Mount points (e.g., `/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev`)

4. **System calls**: Containers rely on system calls to interact with the Linux kernel, including:
        * `fork()` and `exec()` for process creation
        * `chroot()` for changing the root directory
        * `mount()` and `umount()` for managing file systems


While its not required to be a Linux kernel expert to use Docker, but having a basic understanding of the 
concepts mentioned above can be helpful. 
You can start using Docker with a minimal understanding of the Linux kernel and learn more as you go along.

**Recommended resources**

1. **Linux kernel documentation**: The official Linux kernel documentation is an exhaustive resource that 
    covers everything from basics to advanced topics.

2. **Containerization tutorials**: 
    Online tutorials and courses that cover containerization concepts, such as Docker's official tutorials, 
    Pluralsight, and edX.

3. **Linux kernel courses**: Online courses that cover Linux kernel fundamentals, such as Linux Academy, 
    Udemy, and Coursera.

**When to learn more about the Linux kernel**

1. **When you encounter issues**: 
    If you encounter issues with your containers, understanding the Linux kernel can help you troubleshoot 
    and resolve problems.

2. **When you need to optimize performance**: 
    If you need to optimize the performance of your containers, understanding the Linux kernel can help you 
    make informed decisions about resource allocation and limitation.

3. **When you want to customize your containers**: 
    If you want to customize your containers, understanding the Linux kernel can help you create custom 
    images and configure your containers to meet your specific needs.

Understand the Linux kernel's role in containerization is helpful but not mandatory to start using Docker, 
having a basic understanding of the underlying concepts can be beneficial.

### **History and Overview of Docker**

Docker is an open-source platform that allows developers to automate the deployment, scaling, and 
management of applications within lightweight containers. 

Containers encapsulate an application and its dependencies, ensuring it runs consistently across different 
computing environments.

#### **1. Origin and Early History (Pre-Docker)**

Before Docker, the main method of virtualization involved running virtual machines (VMs). VMs are heavy, requiring a complete operating system (OS) for each instance, which consumes significant resources. In the early 2000s, companies like VMware and Microsoft popularized virtual machine technology. However, while effective, virtual machines have overhead due to their need to virtualize entire OS environments.

Around the same time, Linux introduced a feature called **cgroups** (control groups) and **namespaces**, which allowed the isolation of processes in user space without needing a full OS for each process. These tools provided a foundation for creating containers, but it was still complex to implement.

#### **2. The Birth of Docker (2013)**

Docker was founded by **Solomon Hykes** in 2013 as a project within a company called **dotCloud**, which later rebranded as Docker, Inc. Docker’s primary goal was to simplify the use of containers for software developers and IT operations teams. It made the process of packaging, distributing, and running applications much easier compared to earlier containerization technologies like **LXC (Linux Containers)**.

Docker used **LXC** initially as its container runtime but soon moved to its own runtime, **libcontainer**, and later to the modern container runtime, **runc**. Docker's simplicity and ease of use quickly gained traction in the development community.

#### **3. Docker’s Evolution and Ecosystem**

Docker’s success in the software development world led to an expansion of its ecosystem:
- **Docker Hub**: A centralized repository for container images, allowing users to share and distribute containerized applications.
- **Docker Compose**: A tool for defining and managing multi-container applications.
- **Docker Swarm**: Docker’s native orchestration tool for managing clusters of Docker containers.
- **Docker Machine**: A tool to create and manage Docker hosts (VMs or physical machines running Docker).

With the rise of cloud computing and microservices architectures, Docker became a go-to solution for deploying lightweight, portable, and scalable applications. Docker containers allowed for quicker deployment times, easier scaling, and better consistency across different environments.

#### **4. Containers vs Virtual Machines**

While Docker containers and virtual machines are both used to isolate applications, they have key differences:

- **Architecture**:
  - **Virtual Machines**: Each VM runs a full guest OS (e.g., Linux, Windows), along with the application and its dependencies. VMs use a hypervisor (like VMware, VirtualBox, or KVM) to manage the virtualized hardware.
  - **Containers**: Containers share the host system’s OS kernel, meaning they only package the application and its dependencies, not an entire operating system. This makes containers much lighter and faster than VMs.

- **Performance**:
  - **VMs**: Since each VM runs a full OS, they require more resources (CPU, memory, storage) and take longer to boot up.
  - **Containers**: Containers start almost instantly because they don’t need to boot a full OS, and they consume fewer resources due to shared kernel usage.

- **Isolation**:
  - **VMs**: VMs provide stronger isolation since each VM runs a separate OS, providing higher security isolation.
  - **Containers**: Containers offer process-level isolation. While this is generally sufficient for many use cases, the security between containers is weaker than between VMs.

- **Portability**:
  - **VMs**: VMs can be moved between different hypervisor environments, but the image size is often large and the process of moving VMs can be cumbersome.
  - **Containers**: Containers are highly portable as they encapsulate the application and all its dependencies. As long as Docker is installed on the host, containers will run consistently across different environments.

- **Use Cases**:
  - **VMs** are generally used when strong isolation and running full OSes are necessary (e.g., for legacy applications, large applications, or when needing multi-OS support).
  - **Containers** are ideal for microservices, cloud-native applications, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and environments that require fast, efficient resource usage.

#### **5. The Rise of Kubernetes**

As Docker became more popular, managing large numbers of containers across multiple machines became a challenge. This led to the development of **Kubernetes** (initially created by Google), a container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Docker and Kubernetes quickly became a popular combination for managing containerized applications in production.

#### **6. Docker Today**

Docker has become the standard for containerization, and its ecosystem has expanded significantly with additional tools like:
- **Docker Desktop**: An easy-to-use application that runs Docker on macOS and Windows.
- **Docker Enterprise**: A commercial version offering enterprise-level support and management tools.

Docker continues to evolve with a focus on improving security, performance, and developer productivity. The rise of microservices and cloud-native architectures has further cemented Docker’s place in modern development pipelines.
