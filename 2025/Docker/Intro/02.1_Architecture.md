### 1. Docker Engine And Podman:

### **Architecture of Docker**

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. 

The key components of Docker are:

1. **Docker Engine**:
    - The **Docker Engine** is the core part of Docker. It is a client-server application responsible for 
      building, running, and managing containers.
      
      - It consists of:
      - **Server (Docker Daemon)**: 
        This is a background service that manages containers, images, networks, and volumes.
        
      - **Docker Client (CLI)**: 
      The CLI interface that allows users to interact with the Docker Daemon. 
      ( sends requests to the daemon using the Docker API. )

Installation:
    > sudo dnf -y install dnf-plugins-core
    > sudo dnf-3 config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/fedora/docker-ce.repo
    > sudo dnf install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
    
    To enable dockerd on boot:
    > sudo systemctl enable --now docker
    
    Or Manually start when required;
    > sudo systemctl restart docker
    To stop
    > sudo systemctl stop docker
    > sudo systemctl stop docker.socket

Check dockerd daemon is running:
$ ps ax| grep docker
  50745 ?        Ssl    0:00 gpg-agent --homedir /var/cache/PackageKit/36/metadata/docker-ce-stable-36-x86_64.tmp/gpgdir --use-standard-socket --daemon
  50747 ?        SLl    0:00 scdaemon --multi-server --homedir /var/cache/PackageKit/36/metadata/docker-ce-stable-36-x86_64.tmp/gpgdir
  67478 ?        Ssl    0:00 /usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// --containerd=/run/containerd/containerd.sock
  68402 pts/7    S+     0:00 grep --color=auto docker


2. **Docker Daemon**:
    - The **Docker Daemon** (`dockerd`) is responsible for handling all Docker-related operations, such as 
      building containers, pulling images from registries, managing the container lifecycle 
      (ex: start/stop), and more.
        
    - The daemon listens for API requests and can be run on remote systems as well.

3. **Docker CLI**:
    - The **Docker Command Line Interface (CLI)** is the interface through which users interact with the 
      Docker daemon. Commands such as `docker build`, `docker run`, `docker ps`, and `docker stop` are used 
      to manage containers and images.
        
    - It communicates with the Docker daemon through REST API calls.

4. **Docker Images**:
   - Docker images are read-only templates used to create containers. 
     Images are built from a series of layers that contain the application code, libraries, and runtime.

   - You can think of an image as a snapshot of a filesystem that can be used to instantiate a container.

   - Docker images are stored in **Docker Registries** and can be pulled from or pushed to remote
     repositories (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry).

5. **Docker Containers**:
   - A **Docker container** is a runnable instance of a Docker image. 
     It includes the application and its dependencies, as well as a minimal operating system layer.

   - Containers are isolated from each other and the host system, but they share the host OS kernel.
   
   - Containers are lightweight, fast to start, and can be run in any environment where Docker is installed.

6. **Docker Registries**:
   - **Registries** are storage and distribution systems for Docker images. A registry stores Docker images, and it is accessed when pulling or pushing images.
   - **Docker Hub** is the default public registry. Other private registries, such as Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) or Google Container Registry (GCR), can also be used.

### **Podman Overview**

Podman is an open-source container management tool that provides a similar functionality to Docker, but with some key differences. Here’s how it compares to Docker in terms of architecture and usage:

1. **Daemonless Architecture**:
   - Unlike Docker, **Podman** does not require a daemon (the service running in the background). Each Podman command is run as a single process, meaning that containers are directly managed by the user’s process.
   - This makes Podman more lightweight and potentially more secure, since there is no centralized service running with root privileges.

2. **Compatibility with Docker**:
   - Podman aims to be compatible with Docker in terms of command-line interface (CLI). For example, you can replace `docker` with `podman` in most commands. This means that users who are familiar with Docker can easily transition to Podman without learning new commands.
   - For example, the Docker command:
     ```
     docker run -it ubuntu bash
     ```
     Would be equivalent in Podman:
     ```
     podman run -it ubuntu bash
     ```

3. **Pod Concept**:
   - One key difference between Docker and Podman is that **Podman supports Pods**. A Pod is a group of one or more containers that share the same network namespace and storage volumes.
   - This concept is borrowed from Kubernetes, making Podman a good choice for those who want to work with container orchestration tools.

4. **Rootless Containers**:
   - **Podman** allows running containers as a non-root user, enhancing security. This is a key feature that makes it different from Docker, where typically the Docker Daemon runs as root.

5. **Podman and Docker Compatibility**:
   - Podman can be used to run containers in environments where Docker might not be an option or where Docker’s daemon-based architecture is less desirable.
   - Podman also provides integration with tools like **Buildah** (for building container images) and **Skopeo** (for working with container images).

6. **Docker Compatibility Tool**:
   - Podman includes a utility called **`podman-docker`**, which allows you to run Docker commands using Podman as the backend. This helps users transition smoothly from Docker to Podman if they prefer the Docker syntax.

### **Key Differences Between Docker and Podman**

| Feature                | Docker                                      | Podman                                   |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Daemon**             | Requires Docker Daemon running in the background | Daemonless architecture (no background service) |
| **Root Privileges**    | Requires root privileges to run containers  | Can run containers in a rootless mode (no need for root) |
| **Command Compatibility** | Docker CLI required to interact with containers | Podman CLI compatible with Docker CLI commands |
| **Pod Support**        | Does not have built-in pod support (containers only) | Supports pods (grouping multiple containers) |
| **Security**           | Potentially less secure due to centralized root Daemon | More secure with rootless containers |
| **Image Building**     | Uses Dockerfile and `docker build`          | Uses Buildah, but also compatible with `docker build` |
| **Container Orchestration** | Docker itself doesn’t offer orchestration; typically paired with tools like Docker Compose | Podman integrates better with Kubernetes concepts (Pods) |
| **System Dependencies** | Relies on Docker Daemon running as a system service | No dependency on any service, users can run containers independently |

### **Summary**

- **Docker** is a well-established containerization platform with a client-server architecture, relying on a daemon that manages the containers.
- **Podman** is a newer, daemonless alternative that is compatible with Docker’s CLI, but offers additional security and flexibility features, such as running containers without root privileges and supporting Pods for multi-container applications.
- Podman and Docker both share the fundamental concept of containerization, but Podman emphasizes a more secure, lightweight, and user-centric approach.
