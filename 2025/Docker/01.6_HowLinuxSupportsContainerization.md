# Linux and containerization:
---

### **How Does the Linux Kernel Support Containers?**

The Linux kernel provides several features and mechanisms that are essential for containerization, which 
allows for the efficient isolation and management of processes running on the same host. 

Containers leverage these kernel features to provide lightweight, resource-isolated environments. 

Here are the key kernel mechanisms that support containers:

#### 1. Namespaces:
   - **Purpose**: 
     Namespaces provide isolation between processes. 
     Each container runs in its own isolated environment, which includes process IDs, network interfaces, 
     filesystem mounts, user IDs, and other resources. 

     => Namespaces allow each container to think it is running on its own system.

   - **Types of Namespaces** in the kernel:
     - `pid`: Isolates process IDs (allows each container to have its own set of PIDs).
     - `network`: Isolates network interfaces (allows each container to have its own network stack).
     - `mount`: Isolates filesystem mounts (allows each container to have its own mount namespace).
     - `uts`: Isolates hostname and domain name (allows each container to have its own hostname).
     - `ipc`: Isolates Interprocess Communication (IPC) resources like semaphores, message queues, and shared memory.
     - `user`: Isolates user IDs (allows containers to have different UID/GID mappings).
     - `cgroup`: Isolates the resource control and management of processes.

   - **Source Files**: To understand how namespaces are implemented, you can look at the following files in the kernel source:
     - `kernel/nsproxy.c`: The core implementation of namespaces.
     - `include/linux/nsproxy.h`: Header file defining namespaces.
     - `kernel/fork.c`: Handling the creation of new processes and the assignment of namespaces.

#### 2. Cgroups (Control Groups):
   - **Purpose**: 
     Cgroups provide resource management and limitation features. 
     They allow the kernel to allocate and limit resources (CPU, memory, I/O, etc.) for processes. 
     Cgroups are used by container runtimes to ensure containers do not exceed their allocated resources.

   - **Key Features**:
     - Resource limits: Set limits on CPU, memory, and I/O usage.
     - Prioritization: Manage resource access and priorities across containers.
     - Accounting: Monitor resource usage of processes and containers.

   - **Source Files**: The cgroup implementation can be found in:
     - `kernel/cgroup.c`: Core logic for cgroups management.
     - `include/linux/cgroup.h`: Header file defining cgroups.
     - `fs/cgroup`: Contains the cgroup filesystem implementation.
   
#### 3. Overlay Filesystems:
   - **Purpose**: 
     Overlay filesystems (such as `overlayfs`) allow for efficient container storage by using a layered 
     filesystem. 
     It enables containers to share a base image while maintaining the ability to write changes (copy-on-write).

   - **Source Files**: The implementation of `overlayfs` is in:
     - `fs/overlayfs/`: Contains the core code for the `overlayfs` filesystem.

#### 4. Security Modules (e.g., SELinux, AppArmor):

   - **Purpose**: 
     Containers need to be isolated from each other and from the host system. 
     Security modules like **SELinux** and **AppArmor** provide mandatory access control (MAC) mechanisms 
     to enforce security policies within containers.

   - **Source Files**:
     - SELinux: `security/selinux/`
     - AppArmor: `security/apparmor/`
   
#### 5. Namespaces for Process Isolation:

   - **Purpose**: Namespaces provide process isolation, preventing processes in one container from 
     interacting with processes in other containers. This also ensures that containers do not affect each 
     other’s environment.

   - **Source Files**:
     - `kernel/sched/core.c`: For process scheduling and managing process contexts.
     - `kernel/fork.c`: For process creation and PID assignment.

#### 6. User Namespaces:

   - **Purpose**: 
     User namespaces allow processes inside containers to have their own set of user IDs (UIDs) and
     group IDs (GIDs), which are mapped to different IDs on the host system. 
     This allows for privilege separation, where a process can run as a non-privileged user inside the 
     container, but have root privileges on the host system.

   - **Source Files**:
     - `kernel/user_namespace.c`: Core logic for handling user namespaces.

#### 7. Container Runtimes and Kernel Interfaces:

   - **Purpose**: The kernel exposes APIs that container runtimes (such as Docker, Podman, and containerd) 
     use to interact with containers and manage namespaces, cgroups, and other resources.

   - **Source Files**: Interaction between container runtimes and the kernel can be observed in:
     - `fs/`: Filesystem and mounts related to container environments.
     - `kernel/cgroup.c`: For managing control groups that handle resource allocation.

---

### Kernel Source Files to Refer to for Understanding Container Support:

Here are the key files in the Linux kernel source that help you understand how the kernel supports containers:

#### 1. Namespaces:
   - `kernel/nsproxy.c`: Manages the creation and management of namespaces.
   - `include/linux/nsproxy.h`: Header defining the structures for namespaces.
   - `kernel/fork.c`: Contains the logic for process creation and namespace assignment.
   
#### 2. Cgroups (Control Groups):
   - `kernel/cgroup.c`: The main logic of cgroup management.
   - `fs/cgroup/`: Contains the cgroup filesystem code and controls.
   - `include/linux/cgroup.h`: Header file for cgroup definitions.

#### 3. Filesystem Isolation (OverlayFS):

   - `security/selinux/`: Code for SELinux support and configuration.
   - `security/apparmor/`: Code for AppArmor support and configuration.

#### 5. User Namespace:
   - `kernel/user_namespace.c`: Implements logic related to user namespace creation and UID/GID mapping.

#### 6. Control Groups and Resource Management:
   - `kernel/cgroup.c`: Contains resource accounting and management for cgroups.
   - `fs/cgroup`: Implements the cgroup virtual filesystem (cgroupfs).

#### 7. Scheduling and Process Isolation:
   - `kernel/sched/`: Contains the scheduling logic for processes in namespaces.
   - `kernel/fork.c`: Handles the creation of new processes, including those in different namespaces.

### **How Containers Leverage These Kernel Features**:

#### 1. Isolation: 
   - **Namespaces** ensure that containers are isolated from each other, and each container has its own resources, including its own network stack, process IDs, file system, etc.
   - **Cgroups** are used to enforce limits on the resources (CPU, memory, I/O) that containers can use, preventing one container from consuming all resources and affecting others.
   
#### 2. Security:
   - **SELinux** and **AppArmor** provide mandatory access controls to limit the actions containers can perform. This ensures containers cannot compromise the security of the host or other containers.

#### 3. Efficient Storage:
   - **OverlayFS** enables a layered filesystem for containers, allowing them to share a base image while still being able to make changes to their filesystem independently (copy-on-write).

#### 4. Resource Management:
   - **Cgroups** allow precise control over resource allocation and usage, so container runtimes like Docker and Podman can define resource limits (e.g., CPU, memory) for containers.

---

### Conclusion:
To understand how the Linux kernel supports containers, focus on these critical components: 
    - **Namespaces** for isolation, 
    - **Cgroups** for resource management, 
    - **OverlayFS** for container storage, and 
    - **Security Modules** like SELinux and AppArmor.

You can dive into the Linux kernel source to explore the files mentioned above to get a deeper understanding 
of how these features are implemented and interact to provide the foundation for containers.


# Container Applications:

**Docker** and **Podman** are container runtimes that utilize the various kernel features 
(like **Namespaces**, **Cgroups**, and others) to create, manage, and run containers on a Linux system. 

Here's a more detailed breakdown of how these features are used by container runtimes like Docker and Podman:

### 1. Namespaces for Isolation
#### - Purpose: Namespaces provide isolation between processes, which is fundamental for containers. 
  Each container gets its own "virtual" environment, where it has exclusive access to certain resources 
  (e.g., process IDs, networking, filesystem).
  
#### - How Docker/Podman uses it:
  - When you launch a container, Docker or Podman creates separate namespaces for the container. 
    This ensures that the container has:
    - **PID namespace**: 
        Separate set of process IDs (so container processes don't conflict with host processes or other 
        containers).
    - **Network namespace**: 
        A dedicated network stack, including IP addresses, ports, routing, etc.
    - **Mount namespace**: 
        Separate fs view, which allows containers to have their own mounts (or share mounts in a ro fashion)
    - **User namespace**:
        A separate user ID mapping, so a user in a container can be mapped to a different UID/GID on the host.
    - **IPC namespace**: 
        Separate inter-process communication resources (e.g., shared memory, message queues).
    - **UTS namespace**: 
        Isolation of hostname and domain names.

#### - Example: When you run `docker run -it ubuntu`, Docker creates an isolated environment using 
these namespaces, allowing the Ubuntu container to run its own processes, use its own network stack, and 
have its own filesystem.

### 2. Cgroups for Resource Management

#### - Purpose: 
    Cgroups allow the kernel to manage and limit the resources that containers can use, such as CPU, 
    memory, I/O, and more. This ensures that containers do not exceed their allocated resources and affect 
    the overall system or other containers.

#### - How Docker/Podman uses it:
  - When a container is started, Docker or Podman creates a cgroup for it, specifying limits and quotas for 
    resources like CPU usage, memory limits, and I/O. 
    This is how container runtimes ensure containers are isolated from each other in terms of resource 
    consumption.

####  - **Example**: 
    If you run a container with `docker run --memory="512m" ubuntu`, Docker uses cgroups to enforce a memory
    limit of 512MB for that container. 
    If the container exceeds this memory limit, it will be killed (OOM – Out of Memory) by the kernel.

### 3. OverlayFS for Container Storage

#### - Purpose: 
    OverlayFS allows containers to share a base image while maintaining their own writable layer on top 
    (copy-on-write). 
    This makes containers lightweight, as multiple containers can share the same underlying image without 
    duplicating storage.

#### - How Docker/Podman uses it:
  - When you launch a container, Docker or Podman uses a layered filesystem (like **OverlayFS** or **aufs**)
    to provide a filesystem for the container. 
    The base image (e.g., the Ubuntu image) is shared across all containers that use it, while each container
    can write changes to its own layer.

####  - **Example**: 
    run `docker run -it ubuntu`, Docker uses OverlayFS to mount the base Ubuntu image as a read-only layer 
    and then creates a read-write layer for any changes you make inside the container 
    (like installing new packages).

### 4. Security Features (e.g., SELinux, AppArmor, seccomp)

#### - Purpose: 
    These security modules provide additional layers of protection to containers, ensuring that even if a 
    container is compromised, it cannot easily affect the host system or other containers.

#### - How Docker/Podman uses it:
  - **SELinux** and **AppArmor**: 
    Docker and Podman can configure security policies for containers to limit their access to resources. 
    For example, a container might be restricted from accessing certain files on the host system.

  - **seccomp**: 
  Docker can use seccomp profiles to restrict the system calls that containers can make. 
  This helps reduce the attack surface for containers by preventing them from calling certain potentially 
  dangerous system calls.

  - **Example**: 
  run a container with `docker run --security-opt seccomp=seccomp-profile.json ubuntu`, Docker enforces the 
  specified seccomp profile to restrict the system calls the container can execute.

### 5. User Namespaces for Privilege Isolation

#### - Purpose: 
    User namespaces allow containers to map the root user inside a container to a non-privileged user on 
    the host system. This enhances security by limiting the privileges of a containerized root user, 
    reducing the risk if the container is compromised.

#### - How Docker/Podman uses it:
  - Docker and Podman can enable user namespaces to map container root users to non-privileged users on the 
    host system. 
    This way, even if a container runs as root, it will only have limited privileges on the host system.

  - **Example**: 
    `docker run --userns=host`, Docker uses the host's user namespace mapping to ensure the container has 
    the same UID/GID mappings as the host system.

### 6. Container Runtimes (e.g., Docker Engine, containerd, Podman)

#### - Purpose: 
    Container runtimes are responsible for managing the lifecycle of containers, from creation to execution. 
    They interact with the Linux kernel to make use of the above features.

#### - How Docker/Podman uses it:
  - Docker and Podman are container runtimes that manage containers by interacting with the kernel via system calls to create namespaces, cgroups, and other resources. They provide interfaces to start, stop, and manage containers, and they handle the underlying complexity of resource management and isolation.

### How Docker/Podman Interact with the Kernel:

#### - Docker: 
    Docker interacts with the Linux kernel to create containers by utilizing the kernel's namespaces, 
    cgroups, and other features through the Docker Engine. 
    The Docker Engine acts as the intermediary between user commands (`docker run`, `docker ps`, etc.) and 
    kernel-level operations.
    
#### - Podman: 
    Podman is similar to Docker but is daemonless and rootless. 
    It also uses namespaces, cgroups, and other kernel features, but with the added benefit that users can 
    run Podman containers without requiring a long-running daemon (like Docker's `dockerd`).

### Summary:
- **Docker** and **Podman** use the Linux kernel's features like **Namespaces**, **Cgroups**, **OverlayFS**, 
  and **Security Modules** to create isolated environments for containers.
- **Namespaces** provide isolation between containers.
- **Cgroups** manage resource limits and priorities for containers.
- **OverlayFS** ensures lightweight storage by using layered filesystems.
- **Security modules** (SELinux, AppArmor, seccomp) enforce security policies.
- **User namespaces** improve security by isolating container root users.
  
These container runtimes abstract and utilize these kernel features to allow users to run, manage, and 
orchestrate containers easily, providing efficient and secure container environments.
