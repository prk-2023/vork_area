# Podman:

**Podman** can be used in place of **Docker** in all of the examples provided in the previous explanations. instead

Podman and Docker are both containerization tools, but they have some key differences in architecture, 

However, in terms of **functionality**, **usage** of namespaces, cgroups, and resource management, 
Podman behaves similarly to Docker.

Here’s a detailed comparison and how you can use **Podman** instead of Docker:

### 1. **Podman vs. Docker**: Key Differences

- **Daemonless Architecture**: 
  - **Docker** relies on a daemon (`dockerd`) to manage containers. 
  It uses a client-server architecture where the Docker CLI (`docker`) communicates with the Docker daemon.

  - **Podman** is **daemonless**, meaning there is no central server. 
  Each Podman process is managed directly by the user, and Podman runs as a standalone process, 
  making it more secure and potentially more lightweight.
  
- **Rootless Containers**: 
  - **Podman** supports running containers in a **rootless** mode (without root privileges), making it more 
    secure by default.
  - **Docker** generally runs with root privileges or requires the use of the `docker` group, which gives 
    users access to Docker commands with root-level permissions.

- **Compatibility with Docker**:
  - Podman’s command-line interface is compatible with Docker, meaning that for most use cases, you can 
    replace `docker` with `podman` in commands.

  - For example, `docker run` becomes `podman run`, `docker ps` becomes `podman ps`, etc.

### 2. **Namespaces and Cgroups with Podman**

Podman uses **Linux namespaces** and **cgroups** in the same way Docker does, because both tools rely on 
the underlying Linux kernel features to provide resource isolation and control.

- **Namespaces**: Just like Docker, Podman uses namespaces (PID, Network, UTS, Mount, User, etc.) to provid 
  process isolation. 
  When you run a container with Podman, it will create and manage these namespaces to ensure the container 
  is isolated from the host system.

- **Cgroups**: Similarly, Podman uses **cgroups** to manage resource allocation for containers. 
  Resource limits for CPU, memory, I/O, and other system resources can be set in the same way as Docker.
  
You can use the same commands with Podman to control namespaces and cgroups:

    ```bash
    # Run a container with resource limits in Podman
    podman run --memory="512m" --cpus="1.0" --name container1 my_image
    ```

### 3. **Examples Using Podman Instead of Docker**

Let’s look at how you can use Podman with the same examples provided earlier:

#### Example 1: **Running a Container with Resource Limits (Memory and CPU)**

In Docker:
    ```bash
    docker run --memory="512m" --cpus="1.0" --name container1 my_image
    ```

In Podman:
    ```bash
    podman run --memory="512m" --cpus="1.0" --name container1 my_image
    ```

#### Example 2: **Viewing Running Containers**

In Docker:
    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```

In Podman:
    ```bash
    podman ps
    ```

Both commands will display the list of running containers.

#### Example 3: **Inspecting Resource Usage for Containers**

In Docker:
    ```bash
    docker stats
    ```

In Podman:
    ```bash
    podman stats
    ```

Both commands will show the real-time resource usage (CPU, memory, etc.) of running containers.

### 4. **Podman and Cgroups**

Podman integrates with **cgroups** in the same way Docker does. 
It interacts with cgroup subsystems (like `memory`, `cpu`, `blkio`, etc.) to manage and enforce resource 
limits for containers. For example:

- **Setting memory limits**:
      ```bash
      podman run --memory="1G" --name container1 my_image
      ```

- **Setting CPU limits**:
      ```bash
      podman run --cpus="0.5" --name container2 my_image
      ```

Podman uses cgroups to enforce these limits.

### 5. **Podman and Namespaces**

Similarly, Podman uses **Linux namespaces** for process isolation, and it can be used to run containers with 
isolated network stacks, independent process IDs, file systems, and more. 

When a container is started, Podman will create namespaces for network isolation, process isolation, and 
other resource isolations.

For example:
- **Network namespaces**: 
When you run a container with Podman, it will get its own network namespace, making it have an isolated 
IP address, network interfaces, etc.
  
You can use Podman with commands like:

    ```bash
    podman run -d --name my_container --network my_network my_image
    ```

This command will launch a container with its own network namespace (`my_network`).

### 6. **Rootless Containers in Podman**

Podman’s **rootless** container feature allows users to run containers without requiring root privileges, 
which can enhance security by avoiding the need to run a central daemon with root access.

This works in conjunction with namespaces and cgroups to ensure that the containerized application is 
isolated and limited to the resources it is allowed to access.

To run a rootless container with Podman:
    ```bash
    podman run --name container1 my_image
    ```

Podman will automatically set up namespaces and cgroups even when running as a non-root user.

### 7. **How Podman Works with Namespaces and Cgroups in Containers**

Podman, like Docker, leverages namespaces and cgroups for the **isolation** and **resource management** 
of containers:

- **Namespaces**: 
  Ensure each container has an isolated environment (separate networking, file systems, process IDs).

- **Cgroups**: 
  Control and limit the amount of CPU, memory, and I/O that each container can use, preventing resource 
  hogging.

For example, Podman automatically creates namespaces for the network and PID systems and allows 
fine-grained resource management using cgroups, as demonstrated by the examples above.

### Summary:

- **Podman** can be used in place of **Docker** in all the examples provided in this tutorial scope.

- Podman supports **namespaces** and **cgroups** in the same way Docker does, because both tools use 
  Linux kernel features for process isolation and resource management.

- The commands for creating, managing, and monitoring containers with Podman are **very similar** to those 
  in Docker, making Podman an easy replacement for Docker.

- **Rootless containers** are a unique feature of Podman, allowing containers to be run without requiring 
  root privileges.
  
When you prefer using **Podman** over Docker, you can perform the same tasks related to namespaces, 
cgroups, resource isolation, and container management without any issues.
