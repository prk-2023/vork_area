# Fiat is Ponzi-

- This article refers to the USD but should be applicable to any currency of the countries of the world.


- A nation with soaring deficit, soaring debt, and interest payments that can only be made by issuing a
  debt-based currency on whoch even more interest will be due, the USD can only possibly be described as an
  elaborate nation-state level bankster Ponzi scheme.


- Currency of a nation that is backed by Debt, require infinite economic growth to service.

- Without these the below factors the system would collapse:
    1. constant Inflation to erode the debt's value, 
    2. Transferring wealth from savers to the government & bankers,
    3. without new borrowers to sustain current spending.

- Current status:
    - To maintain the financial status, with an absence of a system (petrodoller), the system would loss
      the control to hold every thing in place, ( as no one is at gunpoint to use $ )

    - When stake holders/entities who hold dollers lose confidence, the ponzi scheme collapses, beacuse
      there is no underlying value and not enough new suckers to payback previous waves of investors, this
      is the world we are at, ( As of mid 2024 Saudies / arab nations have not renewed the petrodoller
      contract and they moved to a system where they are open to trace in Rupee, Yuan , Ruble, USD.. ),
      which could mean we have entered a Multi-Polar world from a Uni-polar world, this transition will not
      be smooth.

    - In case of America, for decades they have moved their manufacturing to China and other places, now to
      make their economy to viable levels, which is proposed by Trump is a questionable. So putting extra 
      tariffies to replace income tax may not work as expected.
      Say even tariffies has workd out it would solve the problem of the Worlds largest economics based on a
      ponzi schemes.

- Solution: 
    - Until their is a reversal of dollar to some tangible or real asset Au, the Scam will continue. 
      This Ponzi scheme has been going on since 1971, Accumulating wealth, power, productive working hours 
      of billions of people all across the world, conflicts ... Undoing will require tremendous economic
      pain, which will effect not just Americans but all across the globe, the level of pain depends with
      the level of involvement with the $ ponzi scheme. 

    - "$ is the only clean shirt of the pile". This is meaning less as this is not comparision of one ponzi
      with other. But its a comparision between a ponzi and some tangible.

    - The Chaos that unfolds with the realization that $ was hollow all along, will hurt every one around
      the world, this realization will make it harder to find a new line of suckers to by US debt. 
      ( as of 2024 this is evident from the market trend.. )

    - With 10 year treasure yield raising and major pressure on interest rates to go higher, but the FED
      which is the house of Ponzi along with president trump will be trying to keep the interest rates
      lower.

    - Any form of music,dance, drama to soothen the people view will be hard to change as at 35 T central
      govt is not going to vanish, and a constant deficit and growing debt will only blow the ponzi ballon
      bigger and bigger. ( with the question on every once mind: when does it pop? )

    - A reset can be a way to go back to sound money, but as in 2008, the same powers/bankers who caused the
      crash in the first palce , will the the once to exploit the crash/reset the system again.

- Unfortunately, weâ€™re past the event horizon for the Ponzi. Past the point of no return. No amount of
  economic tinkering, even of the right sort and on a big-enough scale, from Trump or anyone else, can
  reverse or solve the problem without a major implosion causing terrible pain across the economy. Gold is
  one way to protect yourself from the fallout, but when it comes crashing down, no one will be immune to 
  the effects of such a spectacular burst.
