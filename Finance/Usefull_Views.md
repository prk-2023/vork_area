- As of the time March 13th it seems that Au is starting to reveal falsely stated wealth.
  Using some interesting charts of Au vs S-&-P, DX-Y Index and AU-Vs-DXY index.

- Try to protect the saving as much as possible, take as much of your saving out of the financial system as
  possible, as they can come after you. We see there are statements made by Eu commission who is
  un-elected making a statement that they will turn private savings into much needed investment, this can
  be something to do with the CBDC, the ECB plans to bring by october.. ( warning ) Eu citizens need some
  thing outside the system physical for liquidity.

- An ensemble picture of events and news might be pointing to the revelation of falsely stated wealth in the
  financial markets across the world. Or is the entire thing could be a warning sign, for the coming SHTF events (shit
  hitting the fan movement )

- Au is the revealer of falsely stated wealth be it a nation, community, individual. When Wealth gets over
  stated and expectations for future wealth are un-realistic fiat currencies depreciate, that depreciation
  is borne by the citizenry who are forced to lower their living standards to compensate for both personal
  economic management as well as the mismanagement of the affairs of the state. Looking at the
  chronological events since 1970's we  seen this happening over and over, which is very similar to the
  frog and boiling water. 
  The blame can be put on the entire political machinery or the actors who play this game from behind. 

  Financial and military over extension has a social corollary in over promised social security, medicare,
  overstated real-estate, equities affluence as expense runs out of control guarantees to the citizen
  citizenry also explode as politicians seek to rein the privilege of office, but the promises of wealth
  are false the belief that ownership of real-estate is a ticket to fortunes is hollowed for what it is a
  myth.  On these lines we can add BTC, cryptos, tech stocks and, many other forms of speculation wealth
  ... so on and so forth ... 

  Wealth that was taken got granted suddenly appear ephemeral, the amount of currency which once bought
  certain things no longer  does, but on the other hand wages have not risen along with prices, 
  this is unless you are a CEO  or top director in the corporate world or if you are a politician and give 
  yourself big pay perks and great pensions. 

  Instead the wealth citizens get saddled with a big chunk of government debt which is debt
  created by mismanagement and corruption which results in every one paying more for food, fuel and other
  necessities to meet every day needs. Government passes over this mismanagement of economic affairs to
  its citizens by de-valuation and that's what we're going to get. This is a point that most people do not
  understand the devaluation comes from hard assets or real money (AuAg, productive real-estate) which can
  not be devalued against other Fiat currencies, this is a race to the bottom. Money Manager martin
  Amstring artfully stated this " The decline in the value of a currency is in reality a Free Market tax
  taking away wealth that is overstated, So currencies can also be an indirect tax to compensate for the
  poor management of the State. "


- There are two primary different patterns how markets collapse.
    - Fist exponential rise may caused due to speculative fundamentals. These rise exponentially and
      fall exponentially. ( short term panic typically does not lead to ruin ) The spike formation is
      dramatic and highly volatile. 
    - Second type is kick the can down the road, this type rolling over of an en economy is less
      dramatic, but far more damaging. suddenly you wake-up and every thing is changed
      (china,russia,turkey...), there was no spike, just a waterfall effect, that appears to be how a
      political state simply dies with no flare nor big bang. 

      The biggest concern we should have is the defree of volatility if off the charts. We are looking
      at nearly an outside reversal to the downside of the Euro on an annual basis. This degree of
      volatility is truly amazing on an annual level and has not been seen since 1933. Looking at the
      previous chart of pound, in 1933 pound fell to new lows, but then reversed and even exceeded $5
      due to Roosevelt;s 60% devaluation of the $ and the confiscation of Au domestically. The Sheer
      level of volatility is clearly back to the days of Great Depression.
