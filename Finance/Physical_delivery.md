# How to get physical delivery in India

In India, **physical delivery of commodities** can be accessed through specific mechanisms like 
**commodity exchanges** and **direct purchase from dealers**. 

Here's a breakdown of how you can acquire physical commodities in India:

### 1. **Commodity Futures Exchanges (MCX & NCDEX)**

Commodity exchanges in India offer a platform for trading futures contracts in various commodities. 

While futures contracts themselves are typically settled in cash, it is possible to take 
**physical delivery** if you fulfill the conditions and opt for it.

#### **Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX)**:

- **MCX**: Its the commodity exchange in India, where you can trade futures contracts on various commodities
  like gold, silver, copper, crude oil, and agricultural products.

- **Physical Delivery Process**:

    - When you trade commodity futures, you have the option to take physical delivery at the time of
      contract expiry, assuming you are holding the contract at maturity and have sufficient resources to 
      handle delivery.

    - The process involves the exchange allocating physical stocks (like gold, silver, copper, etc.) to the
      buyer based on the agreed-upon terms.

    - **Copper Futures**: You can trade **Copper Futures** contracts on MCX, and if you want to take
      delivery, you must follow the procedures outlined by the exchange, which include:
        - Meeting the contract size (e.g., for copper futures, it's 25 metric tons per contract).
        - Ensuring that the delivery location is approved by the exchange.
        - Taking delivery at an authorized warehouse or delivery center.

#### **National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX)**:

    - NCDEX offers futures contracts on agricultural commodities (like wheat, maize, soya bean, etc.), but
      it is not as focused on metals or non-agricultural commodities like copper.

    - **Physical delivery** in the case of NCDEX works similarly, where you can take delivery of agricultural 
      commodities under specific conditions.

### 2. **Commodity Delivery through Authorized Warehouses**

    For commodities traded on MCX or NCDEX, the delivery is often facilitated through authorized 
    **warehouses** or **delivery centers**.

    - **Warehousing Facilities**: Both exchanges have tie-ups with approved warehouses where the physical
      commodities (e.g., gold, silver, copper) are stored. 
      Upon taking delivery, the commodities are transferred to the buyer's designated warehouse, and you can 
      arrange for transportation.
  
### 3. **Physical Delivery of Specific Commodities**

    Here are a few commodities that you can buy and take physical delivery of in India:

#### **Gold and Silver (via MCX or Banks)**

    - **Gold and Silver Futures**: You can trade futures on MCX for gold and silver. Upon expiry of the
      contract, you can request physical delivery of the metal.

    - **Gold Coins/Bars**: You can also buy **gold coins** and **silver bars** from banks, recognized
      dealers, or bullion markets in India. These are typically available in small denominations.
  
#### **Copper**

    - **Copper Futures on MCX**: Copper is another commodity traded on MCX. If you want physical delivery of
      copper, you can buy copper futures contracts on MCX and opt for delivery when the contract expires.

    - Copper is traded in large quantities (typically 25 metric tons per contract), so it may not be
      practicle for small investors to take physical delivery unless they have the necessary infrastructure 
      for storage and transport.

#### **Crude Oil**

    - **Crude Oil Futures**: Like other commodities, you can trade **crude oil futures** on MCX. However,
      taking physical delivery of crude oil is highly impractical for individual investors because of the
      large contract sizes and the need for significant infrastructure (tankers, storage facilities, etc.).

#### **Agricultural Commodities**

    - **NCDEX**: If you're interested in agricultural commodities like **soybean**, **wheat**, **maize**, 
      or **cotton**, you can take physical delivery of these commodities through NCDEX futures contracts.

    - For example, you can trade **wheat futures** or **chana futures** on NCDEX, and after contract expiry,
      you can take delivery of the physical commodity.

### 4. **Buying Physical Commodities Directly from Dealers**

    If you are interested in owning **physical copper, gold, silver, or other metals**, you can contact 
    dealers who specialize in selling physical commodities:


    - **Copper**: Dealers and manufacturers of copper products (such as copper bars or ingots) can sell you
      copper in its physical form.

    - **Gold and Silver**: Many jewelry stores, banks, and precious metal dealers sell **gold and silver
      coins** and **bars**. For example, **MMTC-PAMP**, **Gold Souk**, and others offer physical gold and 
      silver in various weights.

### 5. **Precious Metal Refiners and Dealers**

    If you are looking for **large quantities** of physical commodities like **gold, silver, or copper**, 
    you can approach refiners or authorized dealers in the metal industry. 
    These entities typically sell metals in large quantities, including bars and ingots.

### 6. **Risks and Considerations**

    - **Storage and Security**: If you take physical delivery, you must ensure safe and secure storage.
      Commodities like copper, gold, and silver require proper storage facilities.

    - **Logistics**: Arranging the delivery and transportation of physical commodities, especially bulky 
      ones like copper, can be challenging.

    - **Transaction Costs**: Physical commodities might involve added costs for storage, handling, and 
      delivery, which need to be considered.

### Summary:

If you want to take **physical delivery** of commodities in India, your best options are:

- **Commodity Exchanges (MCX, NCDEX)**: 
    Through futures contracts and delivery processes at authorized warehouses.
- **Direct Purchase from Dealers**: 
    For smaller quantities, you can buy physical commodities like gold, silver, and copper directly from
    dealerss, banks, and jewelry stores.
  
Taking physical delivery is more practical for precious metals (gold, silver) and agricultural commodities 
than for industrial metals like copper, due to the scale of trading and delivery requirements.

# How to get physical delivery in Taiwan

For someone in **Taiwan**, the process of obtaining **physical delivery of commodities** like copper, gold, 
silver, or other metals would follow a different set of options and regulatory frameworks than in India. 
Here’s an updated guide for accessing physical commodities in Taiwan:

### 1. **Commodity Futures Exchanges (TAIFEX & International Exchanges)**

In Taiwan, you can access commodity futures markets through the **Taiwan Futures Exchange (TAIFEX)**, or 
by using international platforms for commodities like copper, gold, and silver.

#### **Taiwan Futures Exchange (TAIFEX)**


    - **TAIFEX** offers futures trading for a variety of financial instruments and agricultural commodities,
      but **non-agricultural commodities** (like copper or oil) might not be as accessible for direct 
      physical delivery via local exchanges.

    - TAIFEX primarily deals with financial instruments and agricultural futures (such as **sugar**,
      **rubber**, and **soybeans**), but it **does not have futures contracts for physical delivery** of 
      metals like copper.

#### **International Commodity Exchanges** (e.g., COMEX, MCX)

For metals like **gold, silver, and copper**, you can access **international exchanges**:

    - **COMEX** (part of the CME Group) for **gold**, **silver**, and **copper**.
    - **MCX** in India, though you would need a broker that allows access to this exchange, or you can 
      directly trade on **COMEX** via international brokers.

    - **Physical Delivery Process**:
        - Just like in India, you can opt for physical delivery of certain commodities like **gold, silver, 
          and copper** upon the expiry of futures contracts. 
          However, the logistics of receiving physical delivery would be managed via 
          **delivery warehouses** in countries like the US or India, with associated fees for shipping.

### 2. **Physical Delivery through Commodity Brokers and Authorized Warehouses**

    For physical delivery, you would generally work with **commodity brokers** who have access to 
    international exchanges, or with companies that facilitate physical delivery through warehouses.

#### **Precious Metals Delivery (Gold, Silver, Copper)**

    - **Gold and Silver**: You can take physical delivery of **gold** and **silver** via international 
      platforms that offer bullion and coin purchases. 
      For example, companies like **JM Bullion**, **BullionVault**, and **APMEX** ship physical precious 
      metals internationally.

    - **Taiwan-based dealers**: There are also local dealers and stores that sell **gold bars** or **silver
      coins**. You can find these through **Taiwan-based precious metal dealers**, **banks**, and **jewelry
      shops**.
 
    **For Copper**:
    - If you are interested in taking physical copper delivery, there may not be a local exchange in Taiwan 
      that offers **copper futures contracts** with physical delivery. However, you can approach **global 
      copper suppliers** or **metal dealers** who deal in copper ingots, bars, or sheets. 
      These dealers may offer physical copper for direct purchase.

#### **Warehouses and Delivery Centers**

    - When taking delivery of **gold, silver, or copper**, delivery is typically facilitated through 
      **authorized warehouses**.

    - **LME (London Metal Exchange)** or **COMEX warehouses** in other countries would store the physical 
      commodities. For international delivery, the **commodity exchange** facilitates the transfer to a 
      warehouse and then shipping to the buyer's location.

### 3. **Precious Metal Dealers & Jewelry Stores in Taiwan**

    - **Gold and Silver**: Many **jewelry stores** and **precious metal dealers** in Taiwan sell physical
      **gold** and **silver** in the form of **coins, bars**, or **jewelry**.

    - **Taiwan Bullion Dealers**: Look for **Taiwan-based dealers** like **Taiwan Gold** and other local
      dealers that offer gold bars and coins for sale.

    - **Taiwan Jewelry Stores**: Many large jewelry stores also sell **gold bars** and **silver bullion** 
      for investment purposes.

    - **Copper**: If you want to buy **physical copper**, you may need to directly contact metal suppliers 
      or manufacturers who deal in copper for industrial purposes. 
      This is less common for retail investors in Taiwan, but such suppliers exist for those looking to 
      purchase copper in bulk.


### 4. **Buying Physical Commodities via Online Platforms**

    - **Global Metal Dealers**: For commodities like copper, you can look at global platforms that allow 
      individuals to buy **copper** in bulk (e.g., **metal exchanges**, **dealers**). However, this requires 
      the buyer to have appropriate storage and transport mechanisms in place.

    - **Precious Metal Bullion Websites**: Websites such as **APMEX**, **JM Bullion**, and **BullionVault**
      allow you to buy **gold**, **silver**, and occasionally **copper**, with shipping to Taiwan. 
      These platforms generally offer precious metals in **coins** or **bars**.

    - Be aware that shipping costs and import duties may apply when buying commodities internationally.

### 5. **Risks and Considerations**

    - **Storage**: Physical commodities like **copper** and **gold** require secure storage. In Taiwan, 
      storing large quantities of precious metals or copper may require special arrangements with safety 
      deposit services or private vaults.

    - **Logistics**: For metals like **copper**, which are typically sold in bulk, managing logistics and 
      transport can be complicated, especially for individual retail buyers. You’ll need to plan how to get the commodity from the warehouse to your location.

    - **Customs and Import Duties**: Importing physical commodities like copper or precious metals into 
      Taiwan could involve customs regulations, **import duties**, and **taxes**, so be sure to account for 
      these costs.

### Summary:

In **Taiwan**, the options for physical delivery of commodities like **gold, silver, copper**, and other metals are:

1. **Commodity Futures**: Although **TAIFEX** does not offer physical delivery of copper, you can use 
   **global exchanges** like **COMEX** to trade futures in commodities like gold, silver, and copper, with 
   the option of taking delivery upon contract expiry.
   
2. **Precious Metal Dealers**: For **gold** and **silver**, you can buy physical metals from local dealers, 
   banks, or jewelry shops in Taiwan. Physical copper might require finding specialized **metal suppliers**.

   **precious metals** (gold, silver) and sometimes **copper**, with international delivery to Taiwan.
