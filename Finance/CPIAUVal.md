# CPI Inflation Au value :

"If you believe the inflation is understated which it is then Golds purchasing power on the CPI inflation
calculator is overstated."

- CPI inflation calculator which is measured in dollers. 
    Its to be noted that in reality doller is not constant and is not a unit tobe used as a measure. 
    ( Generally the doller as the author defines it: unbacked, debt based, forced currency, dependent 
      on exponential unsustainable growth. And further more the doller is already hyper inflated )

- Since CPI inflation calculator is doller based it would be incorrect to use the gold price from 
  Jan 9th 1980 (which was record gold price when you adjust for inflation,) and plug the price 
  of jan9th 1980 into inflation calculator we will get 3500. 

  Firstly as the inflation is being understated and CPI inflation which uses doller as a measure whose value 
  has been dropping .. Implies calculation of Au price with CPI calulator would be incorrect.


# Basics on CPI and other arguments

The statement **"If you believe inflation is understated (which it is), then gold's purchasing power on the 
CPI inflation calculator is overstated"** highlights a critical debate about how inflation is measured and 
its implications for assets like gold. Here's a breakdown:

---

### **1. The Core Argument**  
The claim hinges on two key ideas:  
- **CPI understates true inflation**: 
    The Consumer Price Index (CPI), the official measure of inflation, may not fully capture real-world 
    price increases due to methodological biases.  

- **Gold’s purchasing power is misrepresented**: 
    If CPI understates inflation, using it to adjust gold’s value will make gold *appear* to retain 
    purchasing power better than it actually does.  

---

### **2. Why Might CPI Understate Inflation?**  
Critics argue CPI has flaws that downplay true inflation:  
- **Substitution Bias**: 
    CPI assumes consumers switch to cheaper alternatives when prices rise (e.g., buying chicken instead of 
    beef). This masks the true cost of maintaining a *fixed* standard of living.  

- **Hedonic Adjustments**: 
    Adjustments for quality improvements (e.g., a faster computer) can artificially lower reported prices.  

- **Excluded Costs**: CPI ignores volatile items like food and energy in "core" measures, as well as asset 
    inflation (stocks, housing).  


**Example**: 
    If your rent rises 10% annually, but CPI reports 3% inflation due to averaging or substitutions, 
    your *personal inflation* is much higher than CPI suggests.

---

### **3. How This Affects Gold’s Purchasing Power**  
Gold is often seen as an inflation hedge. However, if CPI understates inflation:  
- **Nominal vs. Real Returns**:  
  - Suppose gold rises 5% in a year, and CPI reports 3% inflation.  
  - On paper, gold’s "real" return is 2% (5% - 3%).  
  - But if *true inflation* is 7%, gold’s real return is **-2%** (5% - 7%).  
- **Overstated Purchasing Power**:  
  Using CPI to adjust gold’s value makes it seem like gold preserved wealth, even though actual inflation 
  eroded its purchasing power more severely.  

---

### **4. Example in Practice**  
- **CPI Says**: Inflation = 3%  
- **True Inflation**: 6% (due to unaccounted healthcare, energy, or housing costs).  
- **Gold’s Price Increase**: 4%  
  - **CPI-Adjusted Gold**: 4% - 3% = **+1%** (gold "gains" purchasing power).  
  - **True Inflation-Adjusted Gold**: 4% - 6% = **-2%** (gold *loses* purchasing power).  

**Result**: Relying on CPI overstates gold’s effectiveness as an inflation hedge.

---

### **5. Implications**  
- **For Investors**:  
  - If you trust CPI, gold looks like a decent hedge.  
  - If CPI understates inflation, gold’s real protection is weaker than advertised.  
- **For Policymakers**:  
  - Understated CPI lets governments downplay inflation’s impact, keeping interest rates lower than needed.
    This can fuel asset bubbles and wealth inequality.  
- **For Gold**:  
    Its value as a hedge depends on *how accurately inflation is measured*. 
    If CPI is flawed, gold’s true purchasing power may be misjudged.

---

### **6. What Critics Advocate Instead**  
- **Alternative Inflation Metrics**:  
  Use shadowstats.com-style adjustments, MIT’s Billion Prices Project, or asset-inclusive measures.  
- **Tangible Assets**:  
  Gold, real estate, or commodities may still hedge against *true inflation*, but their performance must be 
  measured against realistic inflation rates.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
The statement warns that blindly trusting CPI to gauge gold’s purchasing power is risky. 
If inflation is truly higher than reported, gold’s ability to preserve wealth is weaker than official 
metrics suggest. 
To assess gold’s real value, investors must question how inflation is measured and consider alternative data.  

**Bottom Line**: Gold’s role as an inflation hedge depends on *whose inflation numbers you believe*. If CPI is a flawed yardstick, so too are claims about gold’s purchasing power.


# Detailed analysis:

Here’s an updated, detailed breakdown of the argument, incorporating the nuances of the dollar’s role in 
CPI calculations and gold’s perceived purchasing power:

---

### **The Core Argument**  
The claim asserts two interrelated flaws in how inflation and gold’s purchasing power are measured:  
1. **CPI Understates True Inflation**: 
    The Consumer Price Index (CPI) methodology systematically downplays real-world inflation.  
2. **The Dollar’s Instability Distorts Gold’s Value**: 
    Since CPI is measured in U.S. dollars—a currency the author argues is fundamentally unstable, unbacked, 
    and “hyper-inflated”—adjusting gold’s historical prices using CPI creates a misleading picture of its 
    purchasing power.  

---

### **1. Why CPI Understates Inflation**  
The CPI’s flaws are well-documented by critics:  
- **Substitution Bias**: 
    CPI assumes consumers switch to cheaper alternatives (e.g., buying chicken if beef prices rise). 
    This ignores the *cost of maintaining a consistent standard of living*.  
- **Hedonic Adjustments**: Quality improvements (e.g., smartphones with better cameras) are used to 
    *lower reported inflation*, even if prices rise.  
- **Exclusion of Assets**: CPI ignores housing, stocks, and bond prices, which have skyrocketed due to 
    loose monetary policy.  
- **Geometric Weighting**: Prices are weighted dynamically, underweighting items that rise sharply.  

**Result**: CPI growth (~3–4% in 2024) likely understates true inflation by 3–5x, depending on the metric.  

---

### **2. The Dollar’s Role as a Broken Measuring Stick**  
The author critiques the dollar as:  
- **Unbacked**: No longer tied to gold or tangible assets since 1971.  
- **Debt-Based**: Created through fractional-reserve banking and government borrowing 
    (U.S. debt: $34 trillion).  
- **Hyper-Inflated**: While not hyperinflationary (which implies >50% monthly inflation), the dollar has 
    lost **~98% of its purchasing power** since 1913.  

**Key Point**: If the dollar itself is a depreciating asset, using it to measure inflation (via CPI) 
    compounds the distortion.  

---

### **3. The Gold Price Example: January 1980**  
- **Nominal Peak**: Gold hit **$850/oz** on January 21, 1980.  

- **CPI-Adjusted Price**: Using the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) calculator, 
    $850 in 1980 ≈ **$3,500 today**.  

- **Critics’ Argument**:  
  - If true inflation is higher than CPI (e.g., 7–10% annually vs. CPI’s 3–4%), the 1980 price adjusted 
    for *real inflation* would be much higher (e.g., **$12,000–$15,000/oz**).  

  - Using CPI (a dollar-based metric) to adjust gold’s price understates its *true purchasing power* because
    the dollar’s value is itself collapsing.  

**Example**:  
- **1980 Gold Price**: $850.  
- **CPI-Adjusted (2024)**: ~$3,500.  
- **ShadowStats-Adjusted (2024)**: ~$15,000 (using alternative inflation metrics).  

---

### **4. Why This Matters for Gold**  
- **Misleading CPI Adjustments**: 
    By using CPI, analysts claim gold is “overvalued” today (~$2,300/oz vs. CPI-adjusted $3,500). 
    Critics argue gold is *still undervalued* if true inflation is factored in.  

- **Gold as a Dollar Hedge**: 
    Gold’s price rise reflects the dollar’s loss of purchasing power. 
    CPI’s understatement obscures this relationship.  

- **Hyper-Inflated Dollar**: 
    Even moderate inflation compounds over time. 
    A 2% annual loss in dollar value over 50 years destroys 63% of purchasing power. 
    CPI’s adjustments fail to capture this erosion.  

---

### **5. The Flaw in CPI’s Dollar-Based Framework**  
- **Circular Logic**: 
    CPI measures inflation *in dollars*, but if the dollar is losing value independently of consumer goods 
    (e.g., due to debt monetization or currency debasement), CPI becomes a self-referential metric.  

- **Real-World Example**:  
  - **Housing**: CPI uses “owners’ equivalent rent” (OER), not actual home prices. Since 2000, U.S. home 
    prices rose **~200%**, while OER rose **~80%**.  

  - **Gold**: If gold had tracked true money supply growth (M2), it would be **~$10,000/oz**, not $2,300.  

---

### **6. Implications for Investors**  

- **Gold’s True Hedge**: Gold preserves wealth not against CPI-measured inflation, but against the dollar’s 
    structural decline.  
- **CPI’s Blind Spots**:  
  - **Debt Monetization**: The Fed’s $9 trillion balance sheet (QE) inflated asset prices, not CPI.  
  - **Currency Wars**: Competitive devaluations (e.g., China, Japan) further erode dollar dominance.  
- **What to Do**:  
  - Ignore CPI-adjusted gold prices. Track gold against alternatives:  
    - **Money Supply (M2)**: Gold should rise as M2 expands.  
    - **Real Interest Rates**: Gold thrives when rates are negative (adjusted for true inflation).  
    - **Dollar Index (DXY)**: Gold often inversely correlates with the dollar’s strength.  

---

### **7. Historical Context: The 1970s vs. Today**  
- **1970s**: CPI hit 14%, gold rose from $35 to $850.  
- **2020s**: CPI peaks at 9%, gold hits $2,100.  
- **Critics’ View**: 
    Today’s gold price is suppressed because CPI understates inflation. 
    If 1970s-style adjustments were used, gold would already be at $10,000+.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
The statement’s essence is that **CPI is a politically convenient fiction**, and gold’s purchasing power 
cannot be accurately measured using a yardstick (the dollar) that is itself broken. 
By understating inflation, CPI masks the dollar’s erosion and gold’s true role as a monetary reset mechanism.  

**Bottom Line**:  
- Gold’s value isn’t about hitting CPI-adjusted highs like $3,500.  
- It’s about reflecting the dollar’s loss of legitimacy as a stable store of value.  
- In a world of “hyper-inflated” fiat, gold’s price is not a number—it’s a verdict on the system.  

To quote economist Hugo Salinas Price: 
*“Gold is the money of last resort. When everything else fails, gold will be there.”* 
The CPI, however, will not.
