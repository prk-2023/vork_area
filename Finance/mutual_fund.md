# Mutual Funds:

- Mutual Fund is a Trust that collects money from people who wish to invest via a money pool.
- A fund Manager uses these money to invest in stocks, bonds, assets,.... and he takes care of investing in
  the fund, In return the fundmanager charges 1% to 2% of gain made by the fund.

- Mutual Fund companies are regulated by SEBI.

- If the fund manager is inefficient the investment can loss money on the investments. So its essential to
  know the types of mutual funds: 
  There are 3 major types of mutual funds:
    1. Equity Funds they invest in shares. ( high risk but also give high returns )
    2. Debt funds ( invest in debt instruments, govt bonds, debentures(long term and not backed by colateral
       money)  ( these are safe investments but returns are also lower )
    3. Hybrid funds ( invest in both of the above in certain ratio ) ( moderate returs at moderate risk )
    4. sector funds 
    5. guilt funds and .....

There are many mutual funds in the market and choosing a correct mutual fund can be challenging.
- Tips for investing
    1. Short term 1,2 ( do not choose equity funds choose debt funds as they are low rish then equity funds 
    as they are low risk and have good returns. )
    2. Long term:
        way of payment.
        - Lumsum: payment all at the same time (ex: 1 lakh all at once )
        - SIP : Systematic investment plan ( this can be locked with the savings accounto mutual fund acct)
        
    3. There are three types for the above payments:
        - Large Cap ( fund is invested in big companies that are all well established ) ( lower risk )
        - Mid Cap ( fund is invested in medium sized companies and at moderate risk ) ( returns: moderate)
        - Small Cap ( Fund is invested in small sized companies and is at high risk ) ( returns: high )
        
    4. Parameters that have to be checked: 
        - How much of that mutual fund has made in the past ( check at least 10 yeras )
        - Expense ratio ( how much will that fund manager charges to maintain that account should be @ 1-3%)
        - Entry and Exit load : fees for entering and exiting that scheme. 
    
===>5. Index Funds: In these there is no fund manager and the expense ratio is very less :
        - If you are new then suggested to buy NIFTY 50 and Sensex index funds 
        
- How to Open a Mutual Fund Account:

    1. Select the Mutual fund we wish to opt for by keeing the 5 points from above.
    2. Figure out how much money IN SIP you wish for every month ( or choose lumsum )
    If you want to make 1 cr, 
        On avg Mutual funds returns 16% to reach a 1 cr target would require us to invest 13k Rs for next 15
        years to reach a 1 Cr target. ( you can use the SIP calculator and make a plan accordingly )
    3. PAN Card and KYC compliant
    After these 3 steps:
        contact the relationship manager or go to branch or website to create a Account.


NOTE: MUTUAL FUNDS ARE SUBJECTED TO MARKET RISKS. SO SELECTING A LOW RISK MUTUAL FUND IS CRITICAL.
