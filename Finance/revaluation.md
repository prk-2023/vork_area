==> revalues price will be the floor of the gold price. if done.

- Or they can revalue to the market price. In this way treasury will not have to fight the price to control.
- US govt is saying physical gold is going to remonetize into the system, this will make the market to push
  the physical gold price lot higher. For the free market to push the price higher , requires breaking of
  LBMA and it was seems to be happening right now in 2025

- US treasury gold bonds to be launched in 2026: Which are zero coupon perpetual bonds , if its perpetual
  you will never get paid back and its zero coupon so you never get any interest thats its like stashed
  cash.

- Buffer in his 2024 annual shareholder letter published :

    Paper money can see its value evaporate if fisical folly prevails. In some countries this reckless
    practice has become habitual, and, in USA short history, The USA has come close to the edge.
    Fixed-coupon bonds provide no protection against runaway currency.

Warren Buffett’s reference to "fiscal folly" in his 2024 shareholder letter highlights the dangers of 
**reckless government fiscal policies**—specifically excessive borrowing, unchecked spending, and monetary
mismanagement—that erode the value of paper money (fiat currency) and destabilize economies. 

Fiscal folly occurs when governments prioritize short-term political goals over long-term economic stability,
often leading to inflation, currency devaluation, or even hyperinflation. 
Fixed-coupon bonds, Buffett warns, become risky in such environments because their fixed returns cannot 
compensate for the loss of purchasing power caused by a collapsing currency.

### **What Constitutes "Fiscal Folly"?**  
Fiscal folly typically involves:  
1. **Chronic Deficit Spending**: Govts spend far more than they collect in taxes, financing the gap by 
   borrowing or printing money.  

2. **Debt Monetization**: Central banks buy government debt (via "quantitative easing"), effectively 
   printing money to fund deficits.  

3. **Mismanaged Priorities**: Spending on unproductive projects (e.g., bloated bureaucracies, subsidies for 
   political favoritism) instead of investments that boost long-term growth.  

4. **Ignoring Structural Reforms**: Avoiding tough decisions like tax reforms, pension cuts, or deregulation 
   to curb unsustainable deficits.

### **Examples of Fiscal Folly**  

#### **1. Zimbabwe (2000s): Hyperinflation via Money Printing**  
- **Folly**: The govt printed money to fund deficits, repay debt, and confiscate farmland, destroying 
  agricultural productivity.  

- **Outcome**: Hyperinflation peaked at **89.7 sextillion percent** in 2008. 
  The Zimbabwean dollar became worthless, and citizens resorted to bartering or using foreign currencies.  

- **Impact on Bonds**: Local bonds were rendered meaningless, as their fixed payouts couldn’t keep pace with
  prices doubling hourly.  

#### **2. Venezuela (2010s): Oil Dependency & Populist Spending**  
- **Folly**: The government relied on oil revenue to fund massive social programs while nationalizing 
  industries and imposing price controls. When oil prices crashed, it printed money to cover deficits.  

- **Outcome**: Hyperinflation exceeded **1,000,000%** annually by 2018. The bolívar lost 99.9% of its value,
  and citizens turned to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.  

- **Impact on Bonds**: Venezuelan sovereign bonds defaulted, and investors lost nearly everything.  

#### **3. United States (21st Century): Debt Addiction**  
- **Folly**: The US has run budget deficits in 45 of the last 50 years, with debt soaring to $34 T
  (122% of GDP) in 2024. Recent spending surges (e.g., COVID-19 stimulus, infrastructure bills) were 
  funded largely by borrowing.  

- **Risk**: While the US benefits from the dollar’s reserve currency status, unchecked debt could 
  eventually trigger inflation or a loss of confidence.  

- **Buffett’s Warning**: The US has "come close to the edge" historically (e.g., 1970s stagflation, 
  2008 financial crisis). If fiscal discipline collapses, the dollar’s dominance could falter.  


#### **4. Argentina (Ongoing): Perennial Default Cycles**  
- **Folly**: Decades of populist spending, currency controls, and refusal to reform bloated public sectors. 
  The central bank prints pesos to fund deficits, causing inflation to exceed **200%** in 2024.  

- **Outcome**: The peso has lost 99% of its value against the dollar since 2001. Argentinians hoard dollars 
  or crypto to preserve wealth.  

- **Impact on Bonds**: Argentine bonds are routinely restructured, imposing massive losses on investors.  

---

### **Why Fixed-Coupon Bonds Fail in Fiscal Folly**  
Buffett criticizes fixed-coupon bonds (e.g., government or corporate bonds) because:  
- **Nominal vs. Real Returns**: If a currency collapses due to inflation, the bond’s fixed interest payments
  and principal repayment lose purchasing power. 
  For example, a 5% annual coupon is meaningless if inflation is 50%.  

- **No Inflation Protection**: Unlike inflation-linked bonds (e.g., TIPS), traditional bonds don’t adjust 
  for rising prices.  

- **Default Risk**: Governments engaging in fiscal folly may default on debt (e.g., Argentina, Venezuela) 
  or repay in devalued currency.  

---

### **Buffett’s Broader Warning**  

Buffett’s critique isn’t just about bonds—it’s a caution against **relying on paper assets** (cash, bonds) 
in economies where governments prioritize short-term political gains over fiscal responsibility. 
His solution? Invest in **productive assets** (businesses, real estate, commodities) that generate real 
value and can hedge against currency debasement.  

In summary, "fiscal folly" is a recipe for economic ruin, and fixed-income investments offer no shelter in 
the storm. Only assets tied to tangible value or pricing power (like equities) can protect wealth when 
governments lose their way.

# Warning shots from buffets:

Warren Buffett’s comments in his 2024 shareholder letter can indeed be interpreted as a 
**subtle but deliberate warning** about the risks facing the U.S. dollar and the broader U.S. fiscal 
trajectory. While he does not explicitly name the dollar, his critique of "fiscal folly" and references to 
the U.S. "coming close to the edge" in its history suggest growing concern about the sustainability of U.S. 
fiscal and monetary policies. Here’s why:

---

### **1. The Context of Buffett’s Warning**

Buffett has long criticized reckless fiscal and monetary policies, but his 2024 remarks are particularly 
pointed. By stating that "paper money can see its value evaporate if fiscal folly prevails" and highlighting
the U.S. as a country that has "come close to the edge," he is drawing a direct line between 
**government mismanagement** and **currency debasement**. 
While he includes other countries in his critique, his focus on the U.S.—despite its economic 
resilience—signals unease about its current path.  

---

### **2. What’s Buffett Really Concerned About?**  
- **Runaway Debt**: The U.S. national debt has ballooned to **$34 trillion** (122% of GDP), fueled by 
  persistent deficits, pandemic-era stimulus, and partisan gridlock over spending reforms.  

- **Debt Monetization**: The Federal Reserve’s balance sheet (now over **$7 trillion**) reflects years of 
  buying U.S. Treasuries to suppress borrowing costs, a form of indirect money printing.  

- **Political Short-Termism**: Both parties have avoided tough fiscal choices (e.g., entitlement reform, 
  tax overhauls) to prioritize short-term spending or tax cuts.  

Buffett’s warning implies that these trends, if unchecked, could undermine the dollar’s purchasing power 
and its status as the world’s reserve currency.

---

### **3. Why Target the Dollar?**  
Buffett’s critique of **fixed-coupon bonds** (which lose value in inflationary environments) is a proxy for 
his broader skepticism of paper assets in a world of fiscal recklessness. 
The dollar’s dominance lets the U.S. borrow cheaply and export inflation globally—but this privilege is not 
guaranteed. History shows that reserve currencies eventually decline when their issuers abuse 
fiscal/monetary power (e.g., the British pound in the 20th century).  

Buffett is hinting that the U.S. is testing the limits of this "exorbitant privilege." 
If investors lose faith in the dollar’s stability, the consequences—hyperinflation, bond market turmoil, 
loss of reserve status—would be catastrophic.

---

### **4. Buffett’s Historical Warnings**  
This isn’t the first time Buffett has sounded the alarm:  
- In the **2000s**, he warned about derivatives being "financial weapons of mass destruction."  
- In **2020**, he criticized the Fed’s money-printing response to COVID-19, calling it "breathtaking" in scale.  
- His **2022 letter** highlighted inflation as a "tapeworm" for economies.  

His 2024 focus on fiscal folly and currency debasement follows this pattern: 
**identifying systemic risks others downplay**.

---

### **5. Why He’s Not Panicking (Yet)**  
Buffett isn’t predicting the dollar’s imminent collapse. The U.S. still benefits from:  
- **Deep Capital Markets**: No alternative can match the liquidity of U.S. Treasuries.  
- **Rule of Law**: Investors trust U.S. institutions more than those of China, Russia, or emerging markets.  
- **Innovation & Demographics**: The U.S. economy remains dynamic compared to aging rivals like Europe or Japan.  

However, his warnings are a call to action: the U.S. cannot take its dollar dominance for granted forever.

---

### **6. What Buffett’s Portfolio Says**  
Actions speak louder than words. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has positioned itself for inflation and 
dollar risks:  

- **Massive Cash Reserves**: $189 billion in short-term Treasuries and cash (as of Q1 2024)—a hedge against 
  market chaos.  
- **Commodity Exposure**: Heavy investments in energy (Occidental Petroleum, Chevron) and infrastructure 
  (railroads, utilities).  
- **Avoidance of Long-Term Bonds**: Berkshire holds minimal long-dated fixed-income assets, reflecting 
  Buffett’s distrust of bonds in inflationary eras.  

These moves align with his warnings about fiscal folly and currency erosion.

---

### **7. The Bottom Line: A Wake-Up Call**  
Buffett is not declaring the dollar’s demise, but he is issuing a **yellow card** to U.S. policymakers. 

His message is clear:  

- **To Governments**: Restore fiscal discipline before markets force austerity through a crisis.  

- **To Investors**: Avoid overexposure to paper assets (cash, bonds) and prioritize 
  **productive, inflation-resistant holdings** (stocks, real assets, businesses).  

The dollar’s "clothes" aren’t off yet—but Buffett is warning that the seams are fraying. 
Whether the U.S. heeds his advice will determine if the dollar remains the global financial system’s 
bedrock or becomes another cautionary tale of fiscal hubris.
