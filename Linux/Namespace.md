# Namespace in kernel.

- In kernel Namespace is a way to isolate and group resources, such as processes, network interfaces, mounts
  and IPC objects, to provide a level of isolation and security between different applications or services. 

- Namespace are fundamental concepts of Linux kernel development and are used to implement various features:
    1. process isolation: isolate processes from each other, preventing them from accessing or interfering
       with each other's resources.
    2. resources management: allows kernel to manage resource, such as network interface, mounts, and IPC
       objects, in a more efficient and secure way.
    3. Security: provide a level of security by isolating sensitive resource and preventing unauthorized
       access.

## Types of Namespaces in Linux Kernel:

Kernel has several types of namespaces:

1. Mount namespace **(mnt)**: Isolates the mount points and file systems.
2. Process ID namespace **(pid)**: Isolates the process IDs and allows multiple processes with the same ID
   to coexist.
3. Network namespace **(net)**: Isolates the network interfaces and allows multiple network stacks to
   coexist.
4. Inter-Process Communication **(IPC)** namespace: Isolates the IPC objects, such as message queues and
   semaphores.
5. User namespace **(user)**: Isolates the user IDs and group IDs.
6. Control Group (cgroup) namespace **(cgroup)**: Isolates the cgroup resources.
7. Time namespace **(time)**: Isolates the time and clock resources.
8. UTS namespace **(uts)**: Isolates the system identification, such as hostname and domain name.

## How Namespaces Work in Linux Kernel
---

When a process is created, it is assigned to a namespace. 
The namespace determines the resources that the process can access. 
For example, a process in a network namespace can only access the network interfaces that are part of that 
namespace.

The Linux kernel uses a data structure called `struct nsproxy` to manage namespaces. 
The `nsproxy` structure contains pointers to the various namespaces that a process is a member of.

When a process tries to access a resource, the kernel checks the namespace that the process is a member of 
to determine if the access is allowed. If the access is allowed, the kernel returns the resource to the 
process. If the access is not allowed, the kernel returns an error.


Example of Using Namespaces in Linux Kernel
---

example of using namespaces in the Linux kernel:


    ```c
        #include <linux/nsproxy.h>
        #include <linux/pid_namespace.h>

        // Create a new network namespace
        struct nsproxy *net_ns = create_net_ns();

        // Create a new process ID namespace
        struct nsproxy *pid_ns = create_pid_ns();

        // Create a new process and assign it to the namespaces
        struct task_struct *task = fork();
        task->nsproxy = net_ns;
        task->nsproxy = pid_ns;

        // The process can now access the resources in the namespaces
    ```
Example, we create a new network namespace and a new process ID namespace using the `create_net_ns()` and 
`create_pid_ns()` functions. 
We then create a new process using the `fork()` function and assign it to the namespaces using the
`nsproxy` structure.

**Best Practices for Using Namespaces in Linux Kernel**
---------------------------------------------------

Here are some best practices for using namespaces in the Linux kernel:

* Use namespaces to isolate sensitive resources and prevent unauthorized access.
* Use the `nsproxy` structure to manage namespaces and ensure that processes are assigned to the correct
  namespaces.
* Use the `create_*_ns()` functions to create new namespaces.
* Use the `fork()` function to create new processes and assign them to namespaces.
